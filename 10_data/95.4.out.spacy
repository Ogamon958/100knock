Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a storage facility for steam locomotives that are operated by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) in Kankiji - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
On October 10 , 1972 , Japan National Railway 's 100th anniversary of the establishment of Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) was established in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , and steam locomotives that had been supported by Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) were regarded as valuable cultural properties and the first facility for the purpose of preservation .
After the division and privatization of JNR , JR West took over the JR West in 1987 .
The facility itself is the site of the current car ( Umekoji Line ) , and it is also conducted as an inspection and repairing of the JNR D1010 locomotive owned by Sagano Scenic Railways , which is owned by steam locomotives and Sagano Scenic Railway .
In the first place , this facility started to be established and it was because the steam locomotive disappeared rapidly from the latter half of the 1960 's .
At first , the Oyama - ku district located in Oyama , Tochigi Prefecture was the most candidate for preservation and the site was located near the capital area , but it was officially selected as a preservation institution in 1970 because it was located in the ' central part of Japan . '
In principle , the cars for preservation were examined to select the existing cars ( if it is possible to be the first one can be used , but there are some cars that were not preserved at the beginning , such as C22 cars of C22 .
The facilities are composed of " Steam Locomotive Exhibition Hall , " which utilizes the former Umekoji locomotive and the bicyclopedic type , and " Historical Materials Exhibition Hall , " which was reconstructed and reconstructed by the former Nijo residence of the former Nijo family .
The Ogata Kuri was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914 and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the five tentative ceiling , the ceiling , the ceiling , and the Hikomi Line were designated as national important cultural properties .

The Kyoto Railway was nationally nationalized in 1907 , and after that , it was used as a station building for JR West , but in 1996 , it started to be used as a station building in the section between Nijo Station and Hanazono Station on the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) , and it was reconstructed in 1996 and reconstructed as the main building of the station building in 1997 , and the interior of the station building is used as a relay site for the interior of the building .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
The Ogata Kuri has 16 domestic steam locomotives produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period , and a total of 16 ryo ( 16 ryo at the beginning of the opening ) of domestic steam locomotives ( 16 ryo [ 16 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit of volume ] [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit of volume ] [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit of volume ] [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit of volume ] [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit
At the beginning of the opening , two cars of C53 cars and C51 No.51 were registered in the Ministry of C53 and 239 ; however , there are seven cars for preservation in 2006 and seven cars for the preservation purpose .
Among the five cars , the five cars are still registered at present , and the ' Yamaguchi ' and the ' Kita Biwako ( train ) ' of the Hokuriku Main Line are served on the Tokaido Main Line as well as the ' Yamaguchi ' and the ' Kitabiko ( train ) ' of the Hokuriku Main Line .
Although there is no record of the preservation machine other than these two cars , it can not be operated on the Tokaido Main Line because there are no inspection of the taxation .
In addition , the ' SL Squart ' is operated by the track of the railway in the vicinity of the museum .
This exhibition line was once located north of the depot and was used to be a large - size parking park , but it was changed to the north of the site where it was located in the north of the current large - size parking parking area ( once there was a resting facility and a park ) , but the current Umekoji Park was moved to the site of the former Nijo Station and the south end of the current Umekoji Park was changed to the Sagano Line .
Even now , it has a function as an institution and is also connected to the business route .
Furthermore , after the Takadori factory of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) was closed , steam locomotives were also developed .

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music .
It is a religious music used for rituals and ceremonies .
In Japan , it is also called " Babai " or " Bonbai " or " Bonryo " in Japan .
It is written as " myo " in the old form of a Chinese character .
It is one of the studies of ancient India .
Gogyo refers to five kinds of vocational schools , such as Shomyo ( learning of phonology and gramm ) , Kyoryo ( technology ) , Kyoryo ( study of techniques and technics ) , Iho ( medical science ) , Inmei ( ethic ) , Naimei ( learning of one 's own sect ) , and Naimei ( Buddhists ) .
It has been handed down along with introduction of Buddhism to Japan .
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in 754 during the ceremony of the Great Buddha of Todai - ji Temple , and it is believed that Shomyo was popular in the Nara period .
In the beginning of the Heian period , Saicho and Kukai passed the voice and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo .
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect also have their own voices and are still inherited today .
In order to pass down the oral tradition of kuden , there were no gakufu ( musical instruments ) .
As a result , the denju became difficult for this purpose .
Later , hakase , who was a gakufu ( musical instrument ) , was invented .
There are differences in terms of specialized terms such as hakase depending on each school .
However , Hakase is a reference for chanting and if it is necessary to learn Shomyo ( Shomyo in Japanese ) , it is necessary to keep the school from a master to a disciple .
For this reason , the training of the leaders and successors was required .
Many schools were abolished due to various conditions .
The Tendai Shomyo sect was introduced by Saicho , and its original development became the basis of the transmission of Saicho .
After Saicho , Ennin and Anzen became prosperous .
Ryonin who was the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu is known as the restorer of the family .
In 1109 , Ryoin built Raigo - in Temple in Ohara in Kyoto ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) .
The honorific mountain prefix of Raigo - in Temple in Ohara was changed to Gyosan , the birthplace of Chinese Shomyo in China , and was called Uozan .
Before long , two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the dojo for Shomyo of the Ohara school .
In addition , Jakurehara later became a group of schools , and in Ohara there were voices of two groups .
Later , Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo .
It was based on a new music theory .
Since then , the center of the Tendai Shomyo sect has been passed down to the present Tendai Shomyo .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu , Jodoshu sect , Jodo Shinshu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect Shomyo are descended from the Tendai Shomyo sect .
Shingon - Shomyo is the basis of the transmission by Kukai and has been handed down to the present day .
It has been after the Shinga period when Shomyo has been systematized .
Kancho can be said to be the restorer of the family .
He worked as a composer and improvement of Shomyo ( Shomyo ) .
There were many schools until the Kamakura period , but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho , by four schools ( Honsoin school , Shingonin , Daigo and Nakagawa Daishin ) .
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period .
The Honsoin school and the Shinkoin - ryu and Daigo schools were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
At present , it is divided into Chizan , Chishaku - in Temple , Buzan ( Nara / Hase - dera Temple ) and Nanzan Shinryu ( Nanzan school , Mt. Koya , Kyoto and Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The Ryomei school originated from the Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo of the Shingi Shingon sect ( Shingi Shingon sect Shomyo ) , the Chizan school of the Shingon sect and the Buzan school of the Shingon sect and both of them originated from the Nakagawa Daishin school .
Raiyu adopted the old school of Daigo .
When Negoro - ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583 , both Chizan and Toyosan , formed a new school based on the old school of Daigo and became a part of the school .
The characteristic is that it is called ' ronron ' ( 論論論 ) of Mt. Toyama , ' ron ' ( 論論論 ) and ' shomyo ' ( 明明 ) of Mt. Chizan ( Mt. Chizan .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school of the Nanzan Shingon - shu sect ( Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect ) was the origin of the Nakagawa school .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa Temple in Nara Prefecture .
He moved his base to Mt. Koya from 1232 to 1233 .
It was later called the Nanzan Shinryu ( Nanzan school ) after the name of Mt. Koya .
It is also called Shinryu or Noyama Shinryu .
It can be said that songs such as Heikyoku ( Noh song ) , Yokyoku ( Noh song ) , Minyo ( folk song ) , and Joruri ( dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment ) were transformed into voices .
The influence of a single melody music is greatly influenced by a single melody .

In addition , the cap rank also carried out reforms from the nineteenth floor to the Twenty - six levels from the previous nineteenth floor .
In 670 , he made the oldest family register in his country to create ' Kogo Nenki . '
Emperor Tenchi had the first prince Prince Otomo succeed to the throne , and the Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) says that the Emperor had to succeed to the throne .
However , in the Jinshin War which occurred after the death of Emperor Tenchi , his younger brother Oama ( Emperor Tenmu ) won the victory of Prince Otomo and ascended the throne .
After that , the Emperor Shotoku succeeded to the throne until the reign of Emperor Tenmu .
After the death of Emperor Shotoku , the grandson of Emperor Tenchi , Shirakabe no okimi ascended the throne as Emperor Konin , and after that , it became the Tenchi lineage .
It is said that he sent his four daughters to Prince Oama as the wife of Prince Oama because he had deprived Nukata no Okimi from Prince Oama .
Brief Personal Personal Profile
Empress Suiko ( 626 - born in 626 ) was born .
On July 12 , 645 , he was formally installed as Crown Prince .
Saimei July 24 , 661 - Shosei
On February 20 , 668 , he succeeded to the throne .
January 7 , 672 - He died at the age of 46 .
( " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) says that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated in the mountains because he died of illness after the death of a disease , and there is a theory that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated by the Emperor Tenmu 's side because he said that the Emperor was not aware of the fact that he was in the mountain where he was going to go back to the palanquin of the palanquin and Mt. Nagatsuyama and the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was not known as he was dead . "
It is one of the mysteries of politics in the middle of the seventh century , when Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time and was not enthroned .
There are several theories about this theory .
This is the consideration for the power of the Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , Emperor Tenmu , who was believed to have been a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , is wrong , and it is based on the theory that Emperor Tenmu was born before the Empress Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei , and he was a different father of Emperor Tenchi .
It is certain that the year of Emperor Tenmu was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) and some history books of the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) at the age of the Emperor Tenmu , and Emperor Tenmu became the longer .
However , there are no contradictory contradictions , and there are many historical materials that contain the difference between the age of 8 and 99 .
On the other hand , according to the fact that his father was not different , his younger brother was wrong , he was intentionally saying " Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) " that the age of Tenchi was the age of 16 when his father Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the year of his birth is 614 , which is the year of his birth was adopted by Honcho Koin Jounroku " and so on .
There was a counterargument that " Koji " was not rare in ancient times , and Tenchi and Minto , who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu 's reign , held the Shosei system and did not ascend the throne .
It is said that the errors were mistakenly mistaken in order to avoid the error .
There is also a theory that it is pointed out that other history books which have been pointed out as ' Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) ' are different from the fact that they were compiled in the same period as the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) are not treated as the same .
( Refer to the article on the age of Emperor Tenmu . )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat caused by Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and it is said that Naka no Oe no Oji was driven from the position .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of the policy .
When Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji was able to kill Iruka .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) there is a theory that this theory was based on the fact that it was revised and the theory came to be widely accepted .
In this theory , the reason for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka could not be expelled after the coup d'etat and other doubts can be explained as well .
There is a theory that the enthronement of the Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to the opposition from the relationship between the women of the Emperor Tenchi .
It is said that Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , showed the relationship between her and Tenchi in the poem that she was a wife of the Emperor and a daughter of the same mother of the Emperor Tenchi .
Although the love and marriage between her half brother and sisters were allowed to be allowed to be forgiven , she was actually in love with the older brother of the same mother , but it is interpreted that she was in fact involved in the relationship between her uncle , Michiko TONAKA and her younger brother , and even after she got married to her uncle , Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
After the death of Empress Saimei , the Imperial Princess Hashihito succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous Emperor , but there is a theory that the records were lost due to some circumstances .
In " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) , there is a theory that the Emperor came from the theory that the person who was called ' Naka no Mikoto ' was a princess , and it can be interpreted that the term ' Chuko no Mikoto ' can be interpreted as the Emperor who was in the middle of the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .
If Hashihito no Himemiko = ' Naka no Mikoto , ' the reason why she was called ' Nakanomikoto ' can be said to be a special reason why she had to be called as a special name , but there is a theory that it is not clear whether she was Empress Saimei or Empress Saimei .
Although it is difficult to prove the nature of political history and historical materials , it is difficult to prove it , and the study of the study has been progressed , including the cooperation of archaeologists and so on .

In the Muromachi and Edo periods , he was also known as a family who was the family business of biwa ( Japanese lute ) .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime , the eldest daughter of Tadataka HOSOKAWA ( later disinherited later ) ) , who was a legitimate son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later became disinherited ) and was appointed to Sadaijin ( Minister of the Left ) but Kyumu NAGAOKA donated 600 koku ( crop yields ) to the Saionji family and donated 600 koku ( crop yields ) .

He was the only shogun who did not attend the duties of the shogun in the Edo - jo Castle .
He was Naidaijin ( the Minister of the Interior ) , Juichii ( Junior First Rank ) and the First Order of the Rising Sun .
He was a member of the House of Peers ( Japan ) .
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , who was serving as a guardian , he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
After Emperor Meiji returned to the Meiji government (= Taisei Hokan [ transfer of power back to the emperor ] ) , he tried to reconcile with the Imperial Court but in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , he returned from Osaka - jo Castle to the Edo Castle while he left the former Shogunate army after the Restoration of Imperial Rule and returned to the Edo - jo Castle , and he was ordered to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court , and was forced to surrender .
In the Meiji period , he died of his hobbies and lived until the Taisho period as a duke .
Yoshinobu ' is also read as ' Yoshinobu ' or ' Keiki ' as a common name .
There is a record that the official documents of the Edo bakufu were read as " Yoshihisa " in the official documents of the Edo bakufu .
The name of the word ' Yosai ' is also used in the alphabet and the English language newspaper .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' Yoshinobu ' but in Shizuoka City , where he lived there is often called ' Keiki . '
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu during his lifetime , Yoshinobu seemed to be fond of ' Keiki - sama , ' and he also called himself ' Keiki ' in the telephone of his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA , who was the successor of Yoshinobu , was also called ' Keyu sama ' by people around him .
The two names of ' Keisan ' and ' Keijiki - san ' can be found in modern times , but they are often found not limited to Shizuoka but are often found in various places , and in either case , they are often used as " very close association . "
Ryotaro SHIBA , who was referred to as " Keiki " ( a person in charge of communication between the shogunate and the Kamakura periods ) is said to have ' many people related to the former retainers of the shogun , but it can be said that he was very fond of being in a wide range because he was still familiar with the people of the Higo Domain who were involved in the overthrow of the Shogunate .
On October 29 , 1837 , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was Yoshiko , the lawful wife of his lawful wife , Yoshiko ( the third shogun , Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) , who became the legal wife of the third shogun after Iemitsu TOKUGAWA .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is said to be Oe no kata , who was the lawful wife of his father , Hidetada , but there is a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was Shichiromaro .
In accordance with the educational policy of Nariaki , he moved to the Mito Domain for seven months after his birth , and he was taught academics and martial arts by Shosai ISAWA , who had inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family .
Yoshinobu seemed to have attracted attention from that time , and Nariaki thought that Nariaki was not adopted by other families at first , and he thought that he did not have any adopted son to other families , and he thought that he had to remain in his hands as a hikae ( waiting for his eldest son and legitimate son ) of Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered Shichiromaro from the Mito Domain to become the heir of the Hitotsubashi family of Gosankyo ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) .
In response to this , Shichiromaro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December he was given the name of Yoshinobu by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence and thought that Yoshinobu was a powerful candidate for the successor of the shogun , but he gave up the position of roju Masahiro ABE , who was a member of shogun 's council of elders .
In 1853 , during the chaos of the arrival of the Black Ships , Shogun Ieyoshi died of illness and the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA did not have a son in poor health and had a problem that ' the heir would be the heir of the shogun . '
Nariaki ABE , the lord of the Satsuma Domain , Nariakira SHIMAZU , and the lord of the Kishu Domain , Naosuke II , the lord of the Hikone Domain and the real mother of Iesada 's mother , Honjuin .
The Hitotsubashi school tried to put Tenshoin , an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , into O - oku ( the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants resided ) as a shogun or Midaidokoro , but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another , Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister ) and became Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 .
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and America without Imperial sanction .
Yoshinobu went to Fujiki - jo Castle with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of the Fukui Domain , but on the other hand , he was accused of the crime of Fuitori - jo Castle and was confined to retirement in 1859 .
In addition , Yoshinobu did not want to become the heir of the shogun , but he sent a letter from Nariaki to Nariaki saying ' It is not a translation . '
In 1860 , he was suspended from confinement .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy Shigenori OHARA was guarded by the Satsuma army led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , and the Emperor Komei issued an imperial order to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as a guardian of the shogun , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA ) to become Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On July 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu to the position of Shogun and Shungaku to the position of Seiji sosai .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku did not carry out the reformation of the shogunate called Bunkyu Reforms , and established the Kyoto Shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) and relied on Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as the pioneer of the Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court who was in charge of the expulsion of foreigners .
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , Iemochi was unable to decide the expulsion of foreigners from the emperor and ordered Iemochi to have an audience with Iemochi 's name ' fushin ' ( temporary illness ) .
When the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners ) led by the Choshu clan was expelled due to the Coup of August 18 ( old lunar calendar ) , he went back to Kyoto again to participate in the council of councilors led by the Kobu - gattai ( integration of the imperial court and the shogunate ) and the Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate ) .
However , it can be said that the meeting was not accepted , and it can be said that he was drunk in the sake seats of the Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko and defeated Munenari DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , who were staying in the palace , and also asked NAKAGAWA to discuss the situation that he could not be able to do so , and he also made an end of the situation .
After that , he was appointed to the governor of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto , Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Aizu Domain ) , the lord of the Aizu Domain , and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Kuwana Domain ) , who served as Shugoshiki ( military governor ) and Shugoshiki ( military governor ) of the Imperial Court , and he was in charge of controlling the royalists and court nobles ( Ichikai - bashi Bridge and Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA , who supported Yoshinobu , showed his coolness to the vassals of the Mito Domain , such as Kounsai TAKEDA .
In 1864 , he commanded the bakufu army in the Kinmon Incident , and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of Choshu , he worked hard for the Imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce which had been without imperial sanction and succeeded in obtaining the Imperial sanction of the United States and the United States .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an imperial order of conquest of Choshu .
However , the army of the bakufu refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma Domain which had formed the Satsuma - Choshu Alliance , but the bakufu was defeated .
On July 20 , during the second conquest of Choshu , Shogun Ieshige died in Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu took part in the Imperial Court and succeeded in the conclusion of the Agreement of the war .
Although he was recommended as the successor of Iemochi , Yoshinobu refused it .
On August 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of shogun , but the position of Shogun continued to be rejected .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) asked him to become shogun , but he did not accept it , and on December 5 , he was appointed as Shogun by the Emperor of the Imperial Court .
In other words , he was a shogun who sold his favor and tried to move politics to compete with politics .
Yoshinobu was supported by the French minister , Léon LES , and he established the iron office of 240 million dollars from France and the construction of the Yokosuka River and Shubunsho ( a military adviser ) , and invited the military advisers such as Julian and Franz to reform the military .
In addition , he also encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Paris World Exposition and also encouraged his younger brother Europe to study in Paris where he sent his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was sent to Paris World Exposition Exhibition .
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port , the Imperial Court was permitted .
Yoshinobu predicted that ' the secret imperial decree to overthrow the shogunate was to take advantage of the Satsuma and Choshu , ' and on November 14 , 1867 , he submitted an imperial sanction to the Imperial Court to the Imperial Court ( Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) .
It is said that the Imperial Court judged that there was no administrative capability , and tried to find the existence of the Tokugawa government under the leadership of the council of feudal lords .
However , due to the plot of Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA , the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December of the same year , Yoshinobu was ordered to ' Jikan nochi ( transfer of the post of Naidaijin and the dedication of the Tokugawa shogunate ) . '
Yoshinobu left Osaka - jo Castle in order to avoid conflicts , and he advocated the legitimacy of the Tokugawa clan by gathering ministers from foreign countries , and also made the Imperial Court moves the movement to revise Jikan nochi ( the place where he was in charge of his resignation ) in order to revise his resignation .
However , the following year , 1868 , the Satsuma clan raised an army in the city of Edo , and the soldiers of Aizu , Kuwana Domain were forced to use the soldiers of the Aizu and Kuwana Domains .
However , in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi which broke out on January 3 , when the former Shogunate army was disadvantageous and even though he was still able to maintain his military force , he left the army and retreated to Edo in the military epic " Kaiyo Maru " ( The Battle of Toba - Fushimi ) .
Soon after that , an order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu was issued to hunt down and kill the Emperor 's enemy , and the government army led by the Minister of the Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started the expedition to the east .
Yoshinobu insisted that the resistance faction that Tadamoto ORIKURI was the first to suppress the resistance faction and insisted on obedience .

Yoshinobu was also aware of the overthrow of the Shogunate , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan especially said that ' Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI is not an inaccurate tactic of Yoshinobu ICHIHASHI . '
He was cautious about Ieyasu that he would come back again .
When Ryoma SAKAMOTO decided to return to the Imperial Court , Ryoma SAKAMOTO , ' Daini ( Shogun ) ' and the present mind of the present day will be noted .
It is often said that he was given a lot of kyu , and he was often given to him .
He was highly evaluated by the Emperor and tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser to the new government to Yoshinobu in order to give him his own life to him .
However , Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was the person who knew the existence of Ryoma , and after the death of Ryoma , he became a member of the Meiji period .
There was no story about Yoshinobu and Ryoma was very familiar with the fact that Ryoma was still alive , and the name of Ryoma was very lower than that of the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , and he escaped to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy .
At that time , Ieyasu forgot the horse seals of gold fan , but he did not forget his favorite concubine , and he was ridiculed for Yoshinobu 's weakness .
However , there is a theory that Yoshinobu needed to oppose armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces , and because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the Imperial Court , he was forced to avoid the intervention of foreign countries , even if he was in a long time , even though he was in the position of Osaka Castle , he could not avoid the intervention of foreign countries .
Since it is considered that he was the enemy of the new government and confined to Kanei - ji Temple , he was highly evaluated as a person who valued the emperor and the Imperial Court ( Mitogaku and his mother are thought to have influenced many aspects of the thought of Sono ( reverence for the Emperor and the Imperial Family ) , but on the other hand , it is said that he did not respond to the enemy as his lord .
Due to the fact that it had been transferred to the government in a close close to the Muikei Revolution , it was highly evaluated that it was a great achievement in the Meiji Restoration due to the fact that it was close to the unbroken revolution .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed to the family head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and after the Meiji Restoration , he had a close relationship with the Meiji Restoration .
In his later years , Shibusawa tried to compile the biography of Yoshinobu , and persuaded Yoshinobu , who was astonished and asked him to listen to Naoyoshi 's talent .
This is the " Shakumu Yumeki " ( record of Yumeji in the past ) .
According to a part of the Dankai , it is written in the form of a meeting , and it can be said that it is a slight voice of Yoshinobu who was an old age .
It can be said that at the age of time , Hisamitsu was not so good that he could not like Hisamitsu SHIMAZU but he was a man who was not fond of Hisamitsu but was a person who did not like Naomasa NABESHIMA but was a person who was a person who was a person who was a man of the time .
Based on these materials , the book was completed after Yoshinobu died , and it was " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA " ( Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) .
In order to show gratitude for the Emperor Meiji , who was the highest rank of the kazoku ( peerage ) and the highest rank of the kazoku ( peerage ) was given to the Emperor Meiji , Yoshinobu made a will to perform a Shinshiki ( ritual ceremony ) , instead of a Buddhist ritual .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was not found in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Zojo - ji Temple , which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family , but a circular tumulus similar to that of the Imperial family was built in Tanaka Cemetery .
This is because the Emperor Komei was a good imperial mausoleum , and he was impressed by the Emperor Komei ( " Tokawa Yoshinobu no Konden " [ biography of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ] ) .
When Yoshinobu was pardoned , he wrote that he was a roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) Katsukiyo ITAKURA , who was a member of the shogun 's council of elders who wanted to give his life to the former shogun 's retainers who had offered his life for his life , and then he said that he would have been in love with Yoshinobu .
In the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , there was a weak image of ' enemy escape ' in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , but in recent years , the new modern political system was built after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and there are some movements to reevaluate Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Taiga drama ) .
As with his father , Nariaki , he was fond of pork in the Satsuma Domain , and he was called ' Buda Ichi - sama ' ( means a kind of pork and pork are fond of meat ) .

It is famous as a camera many , but it seems that the technique of camera filming was not progressed .
He often wrote photographic magazine , but it is said that he did not adopt it .

As the Kansai Main Line has its origin as a branch line , the official starting point is Kizu Station , but the train runs from Kyoto to Kizu ( the number of the train numbers ) , and the inbound train is the same as that of the train number .
Except for the following routes , it is described in the section from Kyoto to Kizu unless special data are described .
The color of the line is brown ( ? ) , and it is said that the reason why the selection is the ' image of the two ancient capital ' is the reason for the selection .

Although the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line , the entire section is located in Kyoto Prefecture , and there are no railway lines in Nara Prefecture .
Although the Nara Railway was originally constructed by Nara Railway , the line between Kyoto and Nara was split into a part of the Kansai Railway Company ; after it was merged into the Kansai Railway Company , it was separated from Osaka and Nagoya as a part of the Nagoya Route .
However , trains are operated from Kizu Station to the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) , and Nara Station is operated by Nara Station .
JR West announced the nickname of the line in each line of the Urban Network on March 13 , 1988 , but the Nara Line was sent to see the Nara Line .
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is located on the Kintetsu Nara Line , it is sometimes referred to as ' JR Nara Line . '
In the era of Japan National Railways ( JNR ) , the name ' JNR Nara Line ' was referred to as ' Japan National Railways ' and the English character of the board was also written as ' JR . '
The Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Naniwa , Nara and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , which is in rivalry with the JR Nara Line .
While the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel with many trains , the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 when JNR was electrified , and only the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 105 was operated by a small local line with a few cars that had been operated during the period of electrification even after the electrification of JNR .
However , after JR West was inaugurated , the train was reorganized into four - car trains in the Urban Network Network , and the increase of rapid trains such as ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was rapidly improved due to the increase of the rapid trains such as ' Miyakoji Rapid Service . '
At present , it has a strong nature as a commuting or a route of the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Byodo - in Temple in Uji City , where Uji City is located along the line , and Joyo City , where it is located along the street .
However , it is a circular shape on the east side of the Momoyama - Nitta section , and the section south of Joyo Station is located in parallel with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line running in parallel with the central part of the town , and the transportation between the Keina and the area is still different .
Although the trains of Nara Train Depot are used for Nara Train Depot of the Osaka branch station , the station is managed by Kyoto Branch except for Kizu Station .
The J - Thru ICOCA , ICOCA , and the Suica of the East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , Suica of the East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA and PiTaPa of KANSAI THRU PASS can be used at all stations .
In the south of Joyo Station , the station is a simple ticket gate that is located on the south side of Joyo Station .
In 1984 , the limited express ' Kuroshio ' operated between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station was abolished by the Nara Line , Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line , and until 1991 , only local trains were operated as local trains until 1991 , but nowadays there were four types of local trains that were operated between Miyakoji Station and Rapid trains , Rapid trains , Rapid and local trains that were operated between Kyoto and Wakayama .
It is the nearest type of the Nara Line , and is mainly operated during the daytime mainly during the daytime .
Basically , local trains and local trains are operated between Uji Station and Uji Station because of the intervals of 30 minutes .
The nickname of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was decided by the public before the operation started .
Many of the trains that connect Kyoto and Nara , which are tourist spots , use not only Japanese but also Japanese people but also tourists .
All trains are operated by JR West , which are operated with four - car trains or six cars of the JR West .
The maximum speed of the double - track section is 110 km / h and the maximum speed is operated at 110 km / h , and the speed is 95 km / h other than that is 95 km / h.
Approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara , and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Nara .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamitakoma Station or Tanakura Station in the middle of the station , and there are some differences between the inbound and outbound trains that go to Nara because they are different from the Nara no Miyakoji rapid train .
During the three days of the new year , Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station in order to visit Fushimi Inari Station .
History
March 3 , 2001 : The operation began operating .
March 15 , 2003 : Due to the revision of the timetable revision , the station began to stop at Tofukuji Station and Tamamizu Station .
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours .

All trains are operated in the Series 221 and are operated with four - car trains or six cars .
Basically , local trains and local trains are operated between Uji Station and Uji Station because of the intervals of 30 minutes .
Similar to the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above , the Yamatoji Line stopped at Hirayama Station where rapid trains stopped at the Yamatoji Line stopped at this station .
The stops of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' were used until March 2001 when ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was introduced , and the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 was used in Kyoto and Uji and Joyo ( initially stopping at the station ) , Kizu and Nara , but after that the Nara Line has not been used for the Nara Line .
In the morning and evening , there is a train that directly connects the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line .
It is mainly operated in the morning and night .
It was originally a weekday , but was operated only on Saturday and holidays due to the revision of March 18 , 2006 .
Although trains stop at each station between Uji Station and Nara Station , there was a rapid train bound for Kizu Station in the vicinity of midnight due to the difference between the local trains running at Uji Station and the local trains running at Uji Station , but at present , local trains running on the section were changed to a train that ran at the end of the section .
There are some trains that use JNR 103 series JNR 103 from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays , and all trains are operated on the 221 series 21 .
During the morning rush hour there is a train that runs directly from the Yamatoji Line because it is convenient to operate during the morning rush hours .
Rapid trains on the Nara Line were used as a line line for preventing mistakes with rapid trains in the Yamatoji Line , but due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 2008 , the type of local rapid trains in the section was used as a greenish color due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 2008 .
In the postmark of the station on the north side of Kamikoma Station , it is described as a purple letter .
It runs between Kyoto Station and Uji , Joyo and Nara Station .
During the daytime the section between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station runs every 15 minutes , but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station is operated between Joyo Station and 30 minutes .

Although it was a special train , limited express trains were sometimes operated on the Nara Line .
From 1987 to 1988 , the train was operated by the ' Kuroshi ( train ) ' and was operated between Kyoto Main Line and Hakuhama Station using JNR 381 series Shinkansen train - cars using JNR 381 series electric cars , and the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line and the Hanwa Line via the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line .

Although it was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station as the Miyakoji Rard , the direct trains to the Sakurai Line were operated between Kyoto Station and Nara Station ( Miyakoji Rapid Service between Nara and Nara ) , but no direct trains to the Sakurai Line are operated at present .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Fireworks held nearest to Uji Station , but since the schedule schedule is usually limited to the final schedule , only local trains run between Kyoto and Uji only 10 minutes .
There are some local trains that arrive at and depart from Kizu Station .
The special schedule of the New Year 's Day at that time became completely different and Rapid trains stopped at each station between Kyoto and Uji Station , and the number of trains was increased to the Uji Station .
Depending on the year , there were some trains that came back to Momoyama Station .
In 1992 , direct trains bound for the Sakurai Line extended regular rapid service to the Sakurai Line , and one hour was operated between Tenri Station and Tenri Station .
In addition , the special trains that are operated by the group have been operated from all over the country .
Particularly , when the Tenri Religious Festival held every October 26 , the trains called ' special trains for the Tenri Line ' are operated from Kyoto Station to Kizu Station on the Nara Line between Nara Station and Nara Line and the Sakurai Line via Tenri Station .
All of them belonged to Nara Train Depot .

When the distance between Seta Interchange and Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT , the Keiji Bypass is shorter than Meishin Expressway , the Keiji Bypass is more shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and when it runs on the maximum speed of the maximum speed of the station , the Keiji Bypass runs earlier than the Keiji Bypass via the Keiji Bypass .
Since there are no resting facilities such as the service area , the Meishin Expressway is often crowded with the congestion of the Meishin Expressway , and the rest of the buses of the Meishin Expressway , the Seta Higashi - Oyamazaki Station is the Otsu Service Area , and the Katsuragawa Park .
However , the structure of both the Seta and Oyamazaki Junction , which was established after the name of the god , is a very complicated structure ( especially the structure of the JCTTT of Oyamazaki JCT , which is a very complicated structure , has a complicated structure , is the same as that of the road that is operated by an interval ( especially the section of the Oyamazaki JCT ) .
When you go from Oyamazaki JTT to Suita and Osaka from the Oyamazaki JT , there is an inconvenience that the Meishin Expressway and the left side of the Meishin Expressway .
In addition , since the curve and the sloping road have continued , it does not function as a bypass of the Meishin Expressway .
Since this road is a bypass of National Route 1 ( general national road ) , it is an exclusive road for motorcycles , and it is not a highway for high - speed Expressway .
When you pass the Keiji Bypass from the east side of the Uji - gawa River to the direction of the Uji - gawa River , you must pass through the Uji Nishi Interchange when you go to the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is the Harff IC of the Uji - higashi Interchange .
For this reason , the general road section between the Uji Higashi Interchange and the Uji Nishi Interchange is often traffic during the time of commution .
This general road section is located in the direction of the VISR , so it is difficult to avoid traffic because it is an unnecessary section for the VISS .

Higashi Hongan - ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Jodo Shinshu ( the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) located in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Jodo Shinshu sect ( Shinshu Juha sect ) , which is one of the Shinshu sect organizations , and is the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect along with the head temple of Nishi Hongan - ji Temple ( the formal name of the Hongan - ji school of the Jodo Shinshu sect ) .
The formal name of the temple was ' Hongan - ji Temple ' until 1987 , and after the same year , it was called ' Shinshu Honbyo Mausoleum . '
It is often called ' Oto san ' because it is distinguished from Nishi Hongan - ji Temple in Shimogyo Ward .
( Refer to the article on the history of Hongan - ji Temple before the split split into east and west .
When the 12th head of Hongan - ji Temple , Kyonyo ( 光寿 ) ( 光寿 ) was given a temple territory in the east of Hongan - ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , Kyonyo was established in 1602 when Hongan - ji Temple was divided into two parts .
It is located in the present Karasuma - Shichijo , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , and is located in the east of the Nishi Hongan - ji Temple , which is located in Horikawa - Shichijo , and it came to be called Higashi Hongan - ji Temple .

Amaterasu Omikami is a god ( human ) appearing in Japanese mythology .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , when it was enshrined as a god of nature , it is called ' Ameteru . '
It is one of the deities that deify the sun and are considered to be one of the deities of the Imperial family .
In the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it is written as 天照大神神 ( 天照大神 ) in the Kojiki ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , and in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , it is written as 天下神神 ( 天照大神 ) and also written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
He was also called Ohirume no Muchi no Kami .
In the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , several gods were described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , but in the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it was unified by the name of the god called ' Tensho Daijin ' in the name of the god .
Although she was a goddess , there is a theory that she was actually a male god .
Since the name of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as " Kotai Jingu Gishiki , " it is said that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and became the ancestor of the Imperial family .
In the Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amazume no Okami or Sumeramikami , and it is also referred to as Amasusashinimasu no Oomikami , when the name of the god is enshrined before the festival is held .
In academic documents , the word ' Amaterasu ' and katakana are used as a custom .
There is also a theory that it was written in ancient times as 天照太神 .
Description in mythology
According to the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , when Izanagi came back from the land of Izanami , he washed off the impurities of the dead , and when washing the left eye when he washed the impurities of the dead .
He was born from the right eye and was born from the nose ( nose ) and was called Mikoshi ( three noble children ) .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to govern Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susanoo who was entrusted to Kaibara continued to cry that he would go to Nenokuni where Izanami had lived , so he was expelled by Izanami .
Susanoo met his older sister , Amaterasu Omikami , before he went to Nenokuni ( the Nine Kingdom ) , and he went to Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , but Amateru Oomikami thought that his younger brother would take over Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) and waited for him .
In order to prove the purity of Susanoo , the three goddesses were born from the real reality of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to the god of five pillars , and Susanoo declared the victory .
He was born from the real power of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and was regarded as a child of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and the following five deities are the deities of the following five gods .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Hikutsuhikone
Kusunokuten
Susano who was frightened by this , worked in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amateru Oomikami hid himself in Ama no Iwato ( heavenly rock cave ) .
In the middle of the world , there were various misfortunes in the world .
( The eight hundred million deities including Yagorogi no mikoto and Amenokoyane no mikoto succeeded in making Amaterasu Omikami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , and so on , and Susanoo was expelled from Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
He sent his son Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) .
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) was subdued and Amenohoshihomimi descended after Ninigi was born , Ninigi descended from his grandson Ninigi .
interpretation
In the mythology , Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be a god of the nation because he was born earlier than himself or did not appear in the scene where he was told by Amatsukami ( Takamimusubi no kami ) who was born earlier than his teachings , and Amaterasu Omikami is considered to have been a god of the nation in accordance with the instructions of the god .
There is also a view that the shrine was deified as a god of ancient shrine maidens .
It is also called ' Himeme ' and refers to miko who served the sun god in the ' sun . '
Although the sun god was originally a male god , there is a theory that the shrine maiden who served was identified with the sun god was identified with the sun god and became a goddess .
There is also a theory that this goddess was established in the era of Empress Jito , who was a female emperor , and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami at present .
It has been pointed out that the birth of the sun and Tsukuyomi is strongly influenced by Taoism in the " Ryoho Gofu Jo " ( Commentary on the Five Past of the Sacred Treasures ) of Taoism and the " Ryoho Gofu " ( before the sixth century ) , which is a sutra of Taoism , and the " Ryoho Gofu " ( before the sixth century ) , which is a sutra of Taoism , and the " Ryoho Gofu " ( the first half of the sixth century ) , and the " Nenyo " ( the first half of the seventh century ) , and the " Kyoho Hoin - kyo " ( the first half of the seventh century ) , the beginning of the seventh century ( beginning of the seventh centuries of the seventh century ) .
In addition , the concept of the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Saigu , the Saigu , the Saigu , and the Saikan ( vestment ) of the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Shigi no Miyatsuko ( purification ) ; the Shimoshi no Miyatsuko ( purification ) ; the Miginu ( purple robe ) , the Miginu ( white clothes ) , and the other names of the five colors of the Shinjingu Shrine and the Usuki no kami ( deities of the Ise - jingu Shrine ) , and the Taoist theory that the term of Ojingu Shrine and the Otoyo no miya are different from the names of the Ojingu Shrine and the Ojingu Shrine .
According to comparative mythology , the birth mythology of Amaterasu Omikami was almost equal to that of the ancient mythological mythology which records the ancient period ( 3 to 4 centuries ) , which was recorded earlier than the time of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Also , there is a theory that it is considered that it was a day of the solar calendar , because it spread to Japan along with the ethnic people in the previous period because it spread to Asia throughout Asia .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the shrine was transformed into the third stage .
The following are the events and contents of the movement .
645 : Taika Reforms
Before that , the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
" Hijin no kami " ( 日神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 )
A male god called ' Ameru , ' was widely enshrined there .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines such as ' Akamasu - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima and ' Issunimasu Amateru ' in Harima , ' Amitamiteru ' in Tanba .
Incidentally , the term " Otoko - kama " is also used as the name of Amenohoakari , a grandson of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and Amenohoakari is also the founder of the Owari clan , the Tsunamori clan , and the Kaibe clan .
In addition , the younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi , and the great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : The Jinshin War
Ohihirume no Muchi no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Muchime ' ( Otaru - no - kami , the sun goddess , the sun goddess , the sun goddess , the sun goddess , the sun goddess , the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the other is ' Tanatatsutasumatsume ' ( a woman who is the daughter of the sun goddess , the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , the sun goddess , and the sun goddess , and the sun goddess ,
In this case , the enshrined deity is interpreted as Ohirume no Sumeramikoto , who is a goddess , and there is an interpretation that it is the ' ameteru ' of a snake .
698 : Kotai - jingu Shrine was established .
The ' Amaterasu ( the Sun Goddess ) ' and ' the ancestor of the Imperial family . '
She was a goddess .
Emperor Jito was modeled after the Emperor Jito , and it was created from the nature of the god of nature .
Even after that , the term ' tenteru ' other than Koto - shin was called ' amateru . '
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( Tarashina Diary ) , it is written as ' 天照御神 ' ( 1060 ) , and the part of ' 天照神 ' is also read as ' Ameru , ' and also ' Amatsukume ' in " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
1880 - 1881 , a fierce controversy occurred over the enshrined deities of Shinto Jimukyoku ( Bureau of Divination ) in Hibiya , Tokyo .
In the Shinto Jimukyoku ( the Bureau of Divinations ) , it was decided that the three deities were built as the enshrined deities of the Bureau of Divination , the Takamimusubi no kami , Takamimusubi no kami and the Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , but the Izumo school should be enshrined together with the four deities of the gods , and the Izumo school should be integrated into the world of ' Yuikai ' ( the world ) .
However , the ' Ise school ' which was the center of Shinto Jimukyoku was the ' presidence ' that Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) ruled the two worlds of Kenyu and insisted that the other gods were not a subject .
In the end , there were various views such as ' As the Izumo school had a grudge that had continued since the age of the god ' and ' he should kill Senke Sonfuku , who had a bad mind in the Imperial family . '
Before long , the controversy was taken over by Emperor Meiji 's decision , and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was positioned as the highest rank among them .
It is said that the government recognized that the modern state directly controlled the people through the Fukushin Shinto .
Refer to the controversy of the enshrined deities of State Shinto Jimukyoku ( the Bureau of Shinto Shrines ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA introduced Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) in his own novel to his own novel , and he used another name ' Ohihirume no Sumeru ' ( also known as Ohirume no Ki ) .
Since the term ' Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) ' was used as the name of the sun god and the god appeared in the text of the Imperial family , it was not necessary to use ' Dainichihi hirume no Ki ' because it was a characteristic of the sun god or natural god .
In fact , there are many novels written by AKUTAGAWA that were not corrected and copied by the command , and there are many cases where they were not able to be able to be correct .
In 1926 , Masaatsu YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who established the Kinkei Gakuin School ( 1926 ) said , ' Japan has the belief of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is the ideal to make the world light of Japanese spirit .
When the word ' izana ' in Izanagi and Izanagi 's words is used , it is an ideal of the world 's predecessor , pioneers and guide people who become a monk .
Shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami
The shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami are called Kamimeijinja Shrines throughout the country and the main shrine is the inner shrine ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) of the Jingu Shrine ( Ise - jingu Shrine ) .

Daimyo in the Edo period
The daimyo in the Edo period were determined by the social standing of their social standing and official ranks , the official rank of kokudaka ( crop yield ) and the position of a shikoseki ( consultant ) in the Edo period .
Firstly , due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family , it was classified as tozama daimyo ( tozama daimyo who became vassals of the Tokugawa family ) , mainly fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who was a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara , mainly became a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara .
When the Shogun family line was extinguished , the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of Tokugawa family ) , which were allowed to use the Tokugawa family as well as the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , were established in order to keep the bloodline of the shogun family and support the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was allowed to use the Tokugawa family name of the Tokugawa family as well as the Shogun family and to use the family name of the Tokugawa family as the Tokugawa family , and the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA , the Owari Domain and the 10th son of the Kishu Domain , Yorinobu TOKUGAWA was appointed to the Mito Domain .
In addition , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to the Echizen Domain and a daimyo ( feudal lord ) of the Tokugawa clan throughout the country .
In addition , the fudai daimyo ( a hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who had established the foundation of the Tokugawa Shogun family were placed as fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu , and in addition , he was appointed important posts mainly for roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) to support the shogunate government .
Fudai daimyo were relatively low , and the Hikone Domain of the Ii clan , which was the head of fudai daimyo ( a hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) , was given a relatively large amount of territory of 50,000 koku , but the Torii clan and the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , and the Ogasawara clan , which maintained more than 100,000 koku during the Edo period , were held by the Sakai clan , the Abe clan , the Abe clan , the Horida clan , the Yanagizawa clan , and so on .
This came to be used for separation of power and military power .
After the Battle of Sekigahara , tozama daimyo were daimyo who were subordinate to the Tokugawa family and many families fought against the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara .
However , he was strongly concerned about the shogunate and actively actively actively worked as intelligent activities , and he was severely punished by being punished by being deprived of his fief when he was afraid of his misfortunes or a scheme .

Daimyo were not allowed to have the status of daimyo ( feudal lord ) , and the daimyo with 100,000 koku of rice was almost almost allowed to have a territory in the vicinity of the castle town .
In extreme cases , one village was divided into other feudal lords and governed one village ( shokyu [ salary ] ) .
Although daimyo were more than 10,000 koku ( crop yields ) , the Kiregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was worth 5,000 koku .
This was because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan .
The daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the Buke Shohatto ( laws for samurai families ) and the Sankinkotai system ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
