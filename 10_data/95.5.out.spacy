It is said that he was born as a son of FUJIWARA no Koreko , who was a daughter of Michichika and Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) Motofusa MATSUDONO ( FUJIWARA no Motofusa FUJIWARA ) in Matsudono villa in Kohata in Kyoto , but in recent study , there is a theory that he was the biological child of his foster father , Tomokazu HORIKAWA .
There is also a theory that he was a son of Michichika 's son , MINAMOTO no Michimune or Michimitsu KOGA .
According to the " Kensei Jinkaiki " ( a history book of private sectors ) , he lost his father ( Michichika ) at the age of three , and became an adopted child of his older paternal half - brother , Michichika HORIKAWA , at the age of eight .
According to one theory , after the death of Ryoken , he was adopted by his maternal uncle , Moroie MATSUDONO ( former Minister of the Interior ) , who was the maternal uncle of the Matsudono family , but it is said that Dogen , who felt innocent in the world .
There is a theory that Shinran , the founder of Jodo Shinshu ( the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) , was a relative of the maternal side , but there is no evidence that there is a theory that he had a strong relationship with each other .

In 1213 , he visited his maternal uncle , Yoshiaki , on Mt. Hiei .
In 1214 , he became a priest at the head priest of the Tendai sect Koen , and called himself Dogen of Buddhism .
In 1215 , he studied the Tendai sect under Kintane of Onjo - ji Temple .
In 1217 , he studied under Meizen who was a disciple of Eisai at Kennin - ji Temple .
In 1223 , together with the Ming Dynasty , he traveled from Hakata to the Southern Sung Dynasty , and received inka ( seal ) from the Tendo - Joko of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism .
In 1228 , he returned to Japan .
In 1233 , he founded Kosho - ji Temple in Fukakusa in Kyoto .
Around this time , he was oppressed by Mt. Hiei .
In July 1243 , he was invited by Yoshishige HATANO , a jito ( manager and lord of manor ) of Echizen Province , and moved to Shibisuso in Echizen Province .
On the way , Nobutsuna SASAKI , the feudal lord of Kutsuki - mura Village , responded to the invitation of Nobutsuna SASAKI , and he went to Kutsuki Village ( the origin of Kosho - ji Temple in Takashima City ) .
In 1244 , he opened Daibutsu - ji Temple in Kasamatsu .
In 1246 , Daibutsu - ji Temple changed its name to Eihei - ji Temple and his go ( pen name ) was changed to Maregen .
At this time , he went down to Kamakura by the invitation of regent Tokiyori HOJO , Yoshishige HATANO and others .
It was a half year after the transformation of Kamakura in the Kamakura period , but it became the beginning of pure Zen prosperity in the Kanto region .
In 1253 , he handed over Eihei - ji Temple to his disciple Ejo , and he died at the age of 54 at the age of 54 at the residence of his secular disciple Kakuen ( Takakura - dori Street , Kyoto City ) .
It is said that the cause of his death is a cryster .
Even if it was not completed by a certain level of time , even if it became a Buddha , even if it became a Buddha , it was a true practice to keep the ascetic practices of Buddha ( Shuichi Ichinyo ) and that it was the ultimate practice of sitting meditation .
Many of the Kamakura Buddhism are positively accepted in the Mappo Shiso ( theory of the end of the world ) , but in the record of the Shobogenzo - ki ( record of the record of the Buddhist Statues ) , it is completely uncertain that this word is the origin of this word .
It is a convenient for a period of time in which a statue is placed at the end of the statue of the Buddha , and is convenient for a while .
The true teaching of Sanezane is not accepted .
It should be interpreted as " yorisen . "
He was not always victorious in his lifetime .
There is also an inevitable resolution that it has a shallow mind and a lower root in a sense of view .
The precepts of Buddhism and various kinds of Buddhist precepts are given to all living things and the people who are not able to be able to receive the precepts .
It is the opportunity for all people to be a Buddha .
He thought that he could not always be a person who was a disciple of Shakyamuni , and he stated that ' if you are not able to be able to do so , the end of the legal code is just a convenient . '

Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a storage facility for steam locomotives that are operated by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) in Kankiji - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
On October 10 , 1972 , Japan National Railway 's 100th anniversary of the establishment of Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) was established in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , and steam locomotives that had been supported by Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) were regarded as valuable cultural properties and the first facility for the purpose of preservation .
In 1987 , JR West took over the division and privatization of JNR .
The facility itself is the site of the current rolling stock ( Umekoji Line ) , and it is also conducted by the Japan National Railways D1010 which is owned by the Sagano Scenic Railways , as well as inspecting and repairing this facility .
In the first place , this facility started to be established and it was because steam locomotives disappeared rapidly from the latter half of the 1960s .
At first , the Oyama - ku Ward located in Oyama , Tochigi Prefecture near the capital area , was the nearest candidate for preservation , but it was decided in 1970 that the site was located in the ' central part of Japan ' because it was located in the precincts of Oyama , Tochigi Prefecture , and it was officially selected as a preservation institution of the Umekoji institution in 1970 .
In principle , the cars for preservation were examined to be selected , but there were some cars that were not able to be preserved at first , such as C22 cars of C22 .
The facilities are composed of the " Steam Locomotive Exhibition Hall , " which utilizes the former Umekoji Organ Steam Locomotive Class , and the former Nijo building was reconstructed and reconstructed and reconstructed as " Historical Materials Exhibition Hall . "
The Ogata Kuri was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914 and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the five - tentative ceiling , the ceiling , and the Hikomi Line was designated as a national important cultural property .
In the same year , in 2004 , he was selected as the Minister of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology for the Protection of Cultural Properties .
In 2006 , the former Nijo Station building ( exhibition ) and the Ogi - shako Depot and the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the railway were designated as a national treasure .
The former Nijo station building was built in 1904 with the oldest wooden building in Japan where the Kyoto Railway Company ( JR West ) was constructed as the main shrine , and it was designed to imitate Heian - jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape .
Although the Kyoto Railway was nationally nationalized in 1907 , it was used as the station building of JR West , and after that , in 1996 , the Sanin Main Line between Nijo Station and Hanazono Station of the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) , the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) , the station building was reconstructed , and the station building was reconstructed in 1997 , and the interior of the station building was used as a relay site of the station building .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
The Ogata Kuri has 16 domestic steam locomotives produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period , and 16 types of domestic steam locomotives ( 16 ryo at the beginning of the opening ) which are produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period are displayed .
At the time of the opening of the station , there were two cars of C53 cars and C51 cars of C51 and 2399 cars of C51 were registered in the Ministry of Education , but it has been only seven cars that have been preserved for preservation .
Among the five cars , the five cars are still registered as a car , and the two cars ( C557 and C55160 are ' Yamaguchi ' and ' Kitabiko ( train ) ' on the Yamaguchi Line and the Hokuriku Main Line are served on the Tokaido Main Line .
Although there are no taxis for the preservation machines other than these two cars , it can not be operated on the Tokaido Main Line because there are no inspection in all directions .
In addition , the ' SL Squart ' is operated by the track of the railway in the vicinity of the museum .
Although this exhibition route was once located north of the depot and is now a large - size parking parking park , it was converted to the north of the premises of the former Nijo Station ( once a rest facility and a park ) , and the current Umekoji Park was located in the vicinity of the former Nijo Station and the south end of the current Umekoji Park was changed to the same as that of the Sagano Line .
Even now , it has a function as an institution and is also connected to the business line .
Furthermore , after the Takadori factory of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) was closed , steam locomotives were also developed .
Baime

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music .
It is a religious music used for rituals and ceremonies .
In Japan , it is also called Babai or Bonbogu .
In the old style , it is written as " myo " in Chinese characters .
It is one of the studies of ancient India .
Gogyo refers to five kinds of vocational schools , such as Shomyo ( learning of phonology and gramm ) , Kyoryo ( technology ) , Kyoryo ( study of technology ) , Iho ( medical science ) , Inmei ( ethics ( ethics of one 's own teaching ) , Naimei ( learning of Buddhism ) and other Buddhist monks .
It has been handed down along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan .
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in 754 when the Great Buddha of Todai - ji Temple was held in 744 , and it is believed that Shomyo was popular in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai passed the voice and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo .
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect have their own voices and are still inherited today .
In order to pass down the oral tradition of kuden , there were no gakufu ( musical instruments ) .
As a result , the denju became difficult .
Later , hakase , who was a gakufu ( musical instrument ) , was invented .
There are differences in terms of specialized terms such as hakase depending on each school .
However , Hakase is a reference , and if they practice Shomyo ( Shomyo ) , they are required to teach Shomyo ( Shomyo ( Shomyo ) , they are required to maintain and inherit the school from a master to a disciple .
For this reason , the training of the leaders and successors was required .
Many schools were abolished due to various conditions .
The Tendai Shomyo sect was introduced by Saicho and became the basis of its own development .
After Saicho , Ennin and Anzen became prosperous .
Ryonin who was the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu is known as the restorer of the family .
In 1109 , Ryoin built Raigo - in Temple in Ohara in Kyoto ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) .
The honorific mountain prefix of Raigo - in Temple in Ohara was changed to Gyosan , the birthplace of Chinese Shomyo in China , and was called Uozan .
Before long , the two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the dojo for Shomyo in the Ohara school .
In addition , Jakurehara later formed a group , and in Ohara there was a voice of two branches .
Later , Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo .
It was based on a new music theory .
Since then , the center of the Tendai Shomyo sect has been handed down to the current Tendai Shomyo .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu , Jodoshu sect , Jodo Shinshu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect Shomyo are descended from the Tendai Shomyo sect .
Shingon - Shomyo is the basis of the transmission of Kukai and continues to this day .
It has been after the Shinga period when Shomyo has been systematized .
Kancho can be said to be the restorer of the family .
He worked as a composer and improvement of Shomyo .
There were many schools until the Kamakura period , but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho , by four schools ( Honsoin school , Shingonin , Daigo and Nakagawa Daishin ) .
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period .
The Honsoin school and the Shinkoin - ryu and Daigo schools were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
At present , it is divided into Chizan , Chishaku - in Temple , Buzan Shomyo ( Nara / Hase - dera Temple ) , and Nanzan Shinryu ( Nanzan school , Mt. Koya , Kyoto and Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The Ryomei school originated from the Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo of the Shingi Shingon sect ( Shingi Shingon sect Shomyo ) , the Chizan school of the Shingon sect and the Buzan school of the Shingon sect and both of them originated from the Nakagawa Daishin school .
Raiyu adopted the old school of Daigo .
When Negoro - ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583 , both Chizan and Toyosan , formed a new school based on the old school of Daigo .
The characteristic is that it is called ' ronron ' ( 論論論 ) of Mt. Toyama , ' ron ' ( 論論論 ) and ' shomyo ' ( 明明 ) of Mt. Chizan .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school of the Nanzan Shingon - shu sect ( Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect ) was the origin of the Nakagawa school .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school was founded by Daishinshin of Nakagawa - dera Temple in Nara Prefecture .
He moved his base to Mt. Koya from 1232 to 1233 .
It was later called the Nanzan Shinryu ( Nanzan school ) after the name of Mt. Koya .

( " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) says that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated in the mountains because he died of illness after the death of a disease , and there is a theory that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated by the Emperor Tenmu 's side because he said that the Emperor was not aware of the fact that he was in the mountain where he was going to go back to the palanquin of the palanquin of the Emperor and the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was not able to go back to return to the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was dead . "
It is one of the mysteries of politics in the middle of the seventh century , when Emperor Tenchi did not ascend the throne for a long time and was not enthroned .
There are several theories about this theory .
This is the consideration for the power of the Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , Emperor Tenmu , who is believed to have been a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , is wrong , and it is said that Emperor Tenmu was the Emperor Han , who was born before the Empress Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei , and he was an older brother of Emperor Tenchi .
It is certain that the year of Emperor Tenmu was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) and some history books of the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) at the age of the Emperor Tenmu , and Emperor Tenmu became the longer .
However , there are no contradictory contradictions between the same historical material , and there are many historical materials that contain the difference between the age of 8 and 99 .
On the other hand , according to the fact that his father was not different , his younger brother was bad and he intentionally pointed out in the ' Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) ' that the age of Tenchi was the age of 16 when his father Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the year of his birth is 614 , which is the year of the birth of the Emperor Honcho was adopted , and it is said that he was born in 614 .
There was a counterargument that " Koji " was not rare in ancient times , and Tenchi and Minto , who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu 's reign , held the Shosei system and did not ascend to the throne .
It is said that the errors were mistakenly mistaken in order to avoid this .
There is also a theory that it is pointed out that other history books which have been pointed out as ' Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) ' are different from the fact that they were compiled in the same period as the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) are not treated as the same .
( Refer to the article on the age of Emperor Tenmu . )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat caused by Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and it is said that Naka no Oe no Oji was driven from the position .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of the policy .
When Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji killed Iruka .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) there is a theory that this theory was based on the fact that it was revised and the theory came to be widely accepted .
In this theory , the reason for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka could not be expelled after the coup d'etat and other doubts can be explained as well .
There is a theory that the enthronement of the Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to opposition from the relationship between the women of the Emperor Tenchi .
It is said that Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , showed the relationship between her and Tenchi in the poem that she was a wife of the Emperor and a daughter of the same mother of the Emperor Tenchi .
Although the love and marriage between her half brother and sisters were allowed to be allowed to be forgiven , she was actually in love with the older brother of the same mother , but it is interpreted that she was in fact involved in the relationship between her uncle , Michiko TONAKA and the Emperor Kotoku , and there is a scene in which she was furious about the relationship between her uncle , Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
After the death of Empress Saimei , the Imperial Princess Hashihito succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous Emperor , but there is a theory that the records were lost due to some circumstances .
In " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) , there is a theory that the Emperor came from the theory that he was a princess , and it can be interpreted that the term ' Chuko no Mikoto ' can be interpreted as the Emperor who was in the middle of the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .
If Hashihito no Himemiko = ' Naka no Mikoto , ' it can be said that the reason why she had to be called ' Nakanomikoto , ' but there is a theory that it is not certain .
Although it is difficult to prove the nature of political history and historical materials , it is difficult to prove it , and the study of research has been progressed , including the cooperation of archaeologists and so on .
Poems
He was also a poet of Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) that four poems were handed down to Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) .
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu ( the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by the Heian period , the following poem is included in the beginning of the poem .

In addition , the Saionji clan in Iyo Province was a powerful branch of the Saionji clan , who used the family name of Saionji .
The family crest is made of the left trips .
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane .
Since Michisue 's great - grandchild Kintsune SAIONJI had a niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo as his wife , he was caught by the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and was confined to the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and after the Jokyu War , he was trusted by the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and gained the real power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi ( liaison of the Kanto region ) and gained the social status of Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state .
The name of the Saionji family comes from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his villa in Kyoto ( Kitayama - mura , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono , and the current Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA by the Saionji family .
After Kintsune , he was supported by the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and the power of the Sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) continued throughout the Kamakura period .
Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) , and he put his daughter to the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
However , after his son , Kinhira SAIONJI , the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) came to have a distance from the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and he supported the Jimyoin line and deepened the confrontation with Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) .
After that , when Kinmune SAIONJI died , the Kamakura bakufu fell , and he was dismissed from the position of Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO , who was the remnant of the Hojo clan , and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration , and planned to install the Retired Emperor Go - Fushimi , and Kinmune was arrested due to the betrayal of his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI .
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Sanetoshi SAIONJI who was a son of Kinmune served the Northern Court , served as Udaijin ( minister of the right ) and restored the family name .
During the Muromachi period and the Edo period , he was also known as a family of biwa ( Japanese lute ) .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime who was the eldest daughter of Tadataka HOSOKAWA ( later disinherited later ) ) , who was a legitimate son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later became disinherited ) and was appointed to Sadaijin ( Minister of the Left ) but Kyumu NAGAOKA donated 600 koku ( crop yields ) to the Saionji family and donated 600 koku ( crop yields ) .
In the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted by the Tokudaiji family of the Kanin school , and after the Meiji Restoration , he was active as a politician , and he became a Genro ( elder statesman ) in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods .
Although Kinmochi , who was a family business of the Saionji family , was a hard - time player , he was said to be a bad play by the Emperor Meiji in half of his bad gig , and he was said to be a biwa ( Japanese lute ) of the Saionji family because he was a member of the Gakuryo ( Bureau of the Palace Table ) of the Imperial Household Ministry and the biwa ( Japanese lute ) played by the members of the Gagakuryo ( Bureau of Palace Table ) and the biwa biwa ( Japanese lute ) .

However , in 1946 , the third volume was reevaluated by Jutaro TANAKA ( 1917 - 1987 ) and the second volume was reevaluated , and after World War II , it became a situation where the book was mainly published .
In addition , it seems to have been used in the text of the kotobagaki ( verb book ) , and there are seven sections in the picture scrolls of the Pillow Book , which were created in the late Kamakura period , as well as the " Ekotoba " ( picture scrolls of the Pillow Book ) , which are considered to have been written in the late Kamakura period .
The third volume has more than 300 independent chapters .
In many cases , such as ' Suiso no Hanamo ' and ' Utsukushiki - mono ' type , ' Zuiju - no - dan ' ( Commentaries on the Ruiju ) , which are seen in daily life , and ' Zuishin - no - dan ' ( Commentaries on the Life ) where the author of the Imperial Court who served in the Imperial Court were returned to the court of the Imperial Court , such as ' Teishi no Shi ' ( chapter of the Diary ) , ' Monju ' ( chapter of the Diary ) , and so on .
However , there are differences in terms of classification , such as ' Haru no Akebone ' ( the first section of the chapter ' Haru no Akebone ' ( the first section of the chapter is generally accepted in the popular opinion ) .
It is written in a simple style of Japanese language that uses hiragana ( hiragana , Japanese syllabaries ) , but it is written in general that many of them were written in a simple style of writing and a simple style of writing , but reflecting the decline of the Chancellor , the fall of the family and the empress of his lord , Sadako , reflecting the discrepancy of the death of his lord , and some of the emotional emotions .
In contrast to ' Nohare ' of " The Tale of Genji , " a sensal and sharp observation of the playwright of the author was fascinated and the beauty of ' sakashikashikashi , ' the emotional expression of " The Tale of Genji . "
Vocational evaluations
The " Makura no soshi " ( the Pillow of the Pillow Book ) was deeply loved by human existence , and it was formed as a beauty of various kinds of species in each rank .
In some parts of each chapter from the next chapter , there are various abundant materials inside the context of each chapter , which are not distinguished from the idea of the universe and the universe of the universe and the fence of the skin , and the expression of the skin , which is expressed as a self - expression ( Ogigaya ) .
The expression of ' season ' is a new term used in the Kokinshu ( the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) , which is seen in the Kokinshu ( the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) , while following a telephone of the ' spring ' and ' Hanao ' ( flowers ) which are seen in the Kokinshu ( the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) , he was familiar with the traditional Japanese tradition of waka and was familiar with the sense of consciousness of consciousness of people who were familiar with waka ( Japanese traditional Japanese poetry ) , while he was sluggish by the new emperor ( Toshimitsu SHINDO , who was a master of the same person .
It appeared in the memory of Teishi , the chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) , Teishi .
It was written in order to calm the soul of Sadako who died during the midst of misfortunes that Michitaka had declined .
Therefore , there is no description about the decline of the Michitaka 's family as a result of the decline of the Michitaka 's family ( mentioned above ) .
In the chapter of his own talent , even when the emperor took chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) and chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) , he claimed that he lived in the world of love with the Emperor because he was a favorite of the Emperor , and he insisted that he did not have any relationship with the politics ( Ueno Ri [ Kozuke Province ] ) .
criticism
Even though he forgot from Sei Shonagon , he was a shocked figure who tried to change the status of Sei Shonagon , and he also appeared in the same manner as that of the upper part ( Akiyama ) .
( There is no respect to those who were not a relative of their relatives but a higher social status than those of their relatives . )
It was not written by the qualification of ' individual ' by the ' Bunmei no Bunmei ' ( records of civilization ) of Teishi 's kokyu ( empress 's residence ) , but it was not written by the qualification of ' individual ' ( Junji ISHIDA ) .
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , who reigned from December 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 .
He was the only shogun who did not attend the duties of the shogun in the Edo - jo Castle .
He was the Naidaijin ( minister of the center ) Juichii ( Junior First Rank ) and the First Order of the Rising Sun .
He was a member of the House of Peers ( Japan ) .
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , who served as the guardian , he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
After Emperor Meiji returned to the Meiji government (= Taisei Hokan [ transfer of power back to the emperor ] ) , he tried to reconcile with the Imperial Court but in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , he returned from Osaka - jo Castle to the Edo Castle while he left the former Shogunate army after the Restoration of Imperial Rule and returned to the Edo - jo Castle , and he was ordered to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court , and was forced to surrender the Edo - jo Castle without blood .
In the Meiji period , he died of his hobbies and lived until the Taisho period as a duke .
Yoshinobu ' is also read as ' Yoshinobu ' or ' Keiki ' as a common name .
There is a record that ' Yoshihisa ' was read as ' Yoshihisa ' in the official documents of the Edo bakufu such as the official documents of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
His name is also written as ' Yokosei , ' or in the English language newspapers that he signed alphabet and signed the English dialect .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' Yoshinobu ' but in Shizuoka City , where he lived there is often called ' Keiki . '
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu during his lifetime , Yoshinobu seemed to be fond of ' Keiki - sama , ' and he called himself ' Keiki ' in the telephone of his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA , who was the successor of Yoshinobu , was also called ' Keyu sama ' by people around him .
The two names of ' Keisan ' and ' Keijiki - san ' can be found in modern times , but the names of ' Keisan ' can be found not only in the present day , and in the case of each case , ' Keisan - san ' are often found in various places , they are often used as ' quite a close relationship . '
Ryotaro SHIBA , who was referred to as a former retainer of the shogunate , said ' many people were related to the former retainers of the shogun , but it can be said that they were deeply respected in the broad area because they were able to be used even in the Higo Domain who had been involved in the overthrow of the Shogunate .
On October 29 , 1837 , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was Princess Yoshiko ( the third shogun , Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) , who became the legal wife of the legal wife of the Shogun after the death of the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is said to be Oe no kata , who was the lawful wife of his father , Hidetada , but there is a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was Shichiromaro .
In accordance with the educational policy of Nariaki , he moved to the Mito Domain for seven months after his birth , and he was taught academics and martial arts by Shosai ISAWA , who had inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family .
Yoshinobu seemed to have attracted attention from that time , and Nariaki thought that Nariaki was not adopted by other families at first , and he thought that he did not have any adopted son to other families , and he thought that he had to remain in his hands as a hikae ( waiting for his eldest son and legitimate son ) of Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered Shichiromaro from the Mito Domain to become the heir of the Hitotsubashi family of Gosankyo ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) .
After that , Shichiromaro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December he was given the name of Yoshinobu by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence and thought that Yoshinobu was a powerful candidate for the successor of the shogun , but he gave up the position of roju Masahiro ABE , who was a member of shogun 's council of elders .
In 1853 , during the chaos of the arrival of the Black Ships , Shogun Ieyoshi died of illness and the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA did not have a son in poor health and had a problem that ' the heir would be the heir of the shogun . '
Nariaki ABE , the lord of the Satsuma Domain , Nariakira SHIMAZU , and the lord of the Kishu Domain , Naosuke II , the lord of the Hikone Domain and the real mother of Iesada 's mother , Honjuin .
The Hitotsubashi school tried to put Tenshoin as the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , and sent to O - oku ( inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside ) , but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another , Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister ) and became Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 .
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan .
Yoshinobu went to Fujiki - jo Castle with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of the Fukui Domain , but on the other hand , he was accused of Naosuke 's crime and was confined to retirement in 1859 ( the Ansei no Taigoku ) .
It is said that Yoshinobu did not want to become the heir of the shogun , but he sent a letter from Nariaki to Nariaki saying ' It is not a translation . '
In 1860 , he was suspended from confinement .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy Shigenori OHARA was guarded by the Satsuma army led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , and the Emperor Komei issued an imperial order to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as a guardian , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA ) to become Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On July 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu to the position of Shogun and Shungaku to the position of Seiji sosai .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku did not carry out the reform of the shogunate called Bunkyu Reforms , and established the Kyoto Shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) and relied on Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as the pioneer of the Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court who was in charge of the expulsion of foreigners .
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , Iemochi was unable to decide the expulsion of foreigners from the emperor and ordered Iemochi to have an audience with Iemochi , who was called ' fushin ' ( temporary illness ) .
When the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners ) led by the Choshu clan was expelled due to the Coup of August 18 ( old lunar calendar ) , he went back to Kyoto again to participate in the council of councilors led by the Kobu - gattai ( integration of the imperial court and the shogunate ) and the Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate ) .
However , it can be said that the meeting was not accepted , and it can be said that he was drunk in the sake seats of the Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko and defeated Munenari DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU who were staying there , and also asked NAKAGAWA to discuss the situation that he would not be able to stop the situation , and he also negotiated with Nakagawa no Miya as a means of the collapse of the system .
After that , he was appointed to the governor of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto , Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Aizu Domain ) , the lord of the Aizu Domain , and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Kuwana Domain ) , who held the position of Shugoshiki ( military governor ) and Shugoshiki ( military governor of the Imperial Court , and he was in charge of controlling the royalists and court nobles ( Ichikai - bashi Bridge and Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA and other vassals of the Mito Domain , who supported Yoshinobu , showed the coolness to the vassals of the Mito Domain , such as Kounsai TAKEDA .
In 1864 , he commanded the bakufu army in the Kinmon Incident , and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of Choshu , he worked hard for the Imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce which had been without imperial sanction and succeeded in obtaining the Imperial sanction of the United States .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an imperial order of conquest of Choshu .
However , the army of the bakufu refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma Domain who had formed the Satsuma - Choshu Alliance , but was defeated .
On July 20 , during the second conquest of Choshu , Shogun Ieshige died in Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu took part in the Imperial Court and succeeded in the conclusion of the Agreement of the war .
Although he was recommended as the successor of Iemochi , Yoshinobu firmly refused it .
On August 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of shogun , but the position of Shogun continued to be rejected .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) asked him to assume the position of shogun , but he did not accept it , and on December 5 , he was appointed as Shogun by the Emperor of the Imperial Court .
In other words , he was a shogun who sold his favor and tried to move politics to compete with politics .
Yoshinobu was supported by the French minister , Léon LES , and he established the iron office of 240 million dollars from France , and he invited the military advisers such as Julian and Britain to reform the military .
In addition , he also encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Paris World Exposition , and he encouraged his younger brother Europe to study in Paris where he sent his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was sent to Paris World Exposition Exhibition .
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port , the Imperial Court was permitted .
Yoshinobu predicted the ' secret imperial decree to overthrow the shogunate from the Satsuma and Choshu , ' and on November 14 , 1867 , he was sent back to the Imperial Court to the Imperial Court and received an imperial sanction ( Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) .
It is said that the Imperial Court judged that there was no administrative capability , and tried to find the existence of the Tokugawa government under the leadership of the council of feudal lords .
However , due to the plot of Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA , the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December of the same year , Yoshinobu was ordered to ' Jikan nochi ( transfer of the post of Naidaijin and the dedication of the Tokugawa shogunate ) . '
Yoshinobu left Osaka - jo Castle in order to avoid conflicts , and he advocated the legitimacy of the Tokugawa clan by gathering ministers from foreign countries , and also made a campaign to revise the Imperial Court by revising his resignation .
However , the following year , 1868 , the Satsuma clan raised an army in the city of Edo , and the soldiers of Aizu , Kuwana Domain were forced to use the soldiers of the Aizu and Kuwana Domains .
However , in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi which broke out on January 3 , when the former Shogunate army was disadvantageous and even though he was still able to maintain his military force , he left the army and retreated to Edo in the military epic " Kaiyo Maru " ( The Battle of Toba - Fushimi ) .
Soon after that , the order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu 's enemy , and the government army led by the Minister of the Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started the expedition to the east .
Yoshinobu insisted on the resistance faction that Tadaosa KOKURI was the beginning of the battle , and insisted on allegiance to him .
In February , Kaishu KATSU was appointed to the position of Kaishu KATSU , and he himself was confined in Daiji - in Temple in Ueno Kanei - ji Temple .

On the same day , he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun .
He was born in the highest environmental environment and was enthusiastic about swordplay from various martial arts .
Even after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he is counted as one of the most famous swordsmiths of the swordplay that do not hold the training of the back of the swordplay .
When his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA was hiding in the barrel , he was just a threat of the barrel , and it is said that the sword was removed from the barrel , when his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA became a problem of the succession of the Tokugawa family .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote that when he became adulthood , he was in the same position as two of his wife and two mistresses in the name of ' ya ' ( y ) , and he had been on the same side as three people .
Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph in his childhood , but it is doubtful that the photograph of Yoshinobu could not be found in Japan during his childhood .
It is said that he visited Iemochi , who fell ill and fell ill and became popular at that time .
He was known for his brilliant life , and he was praised by his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA and Tatewaki YASUSHIMA praised Yoshinobu as ' purifying the Tokugawa flow of the Tokugawa family , ' and when he took the position of Shogun with the expectation of the power of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , he took the position of shogun , he was praised as ' Ieyasu TOKUGAWA . '
Yoshinobu was also aware of the anti - shogunate faction , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan especially said that ' Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI is not an inaccurate tactic of Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI . '
He was cautious about Ieyasu that he would come back again .
When Ryoma SAKAMOTO decided to return to the Imperial Court , Ryoma SAKAMOTO , ' Daini ( Shogun ) Ko , and now we know what it is true .
It is often said that they are given to them and they are often required to be given to him .
He made his mind and pledge to give him a ' abandon my life , ' and Yoshinobu tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser of the new government to Yoshinobu .
However , Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was the person who knew the existence of Ryoma after Ryoma 's death ( after Ryoma 's death ) in the Meiji period .
There was no story about Yoshinobu and Ryoma was very familiar with the fact that Ryoma was still alive , and he was very lower than that of the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , and went back to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy .
At that time , Ieyasu forgot the horse seals of gold fan , but he did not forget his favorite concubine , and he was ridiculed for Yoshinobu 's weakness .
However , there is a theory that Yoshinobu needed to oppose armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces , and because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the Imperial Court , he was forced to avoid the intervention of foreign countries , even if he was in a long - term battle , even if he had to protect Osaka - jo Castle in order to avoid the intervention of foreign countries .
Since it is considered that he was the enemy of the new government and confined to Kanei - ji Temple , he was evaluated as a person who valued the emperor and the Imperial Court ( Mitogaku and his mother are thought to have influenced many aspects of reverence for the Emperor and the Imperial Family ) , but on the other hand , it is said that he did not respond to the enemy as his lord .
It was highly evaluated that the modern independence of Japan was protected due to the fact that it was close to the unbroken revolutionary revolution , because it was located close to the unbroken revolution , and the restoration of the Meiji Restoration .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed to the family head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and after the Meiji Restoration , he had a close relationship with the Meiji Restoration .
In the last days of Yoshinobu , Shibusawa tried to compile the biography of Yoshinobu , and persuaded Yoshinobu , who was astonished and asked him to listen to Naoyoshi 's talent .
The book was compiled in the " " Konjaku Yumeji hikki " ( diary of Yumeji YOSHIDA ) .
According to a part of the Dankai , it is written in the form of a meeting , and it can be said that it is a slight voice of Yoshinobu who was an old age .
It can be guessed that he had a bad reputation for the age of his age , and he said , ' Hisamitsu SHIMAZU was not very fond of Hisamitsu SHIMAZU ' and ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was not a good person .
Based on these materials , the book was completed after Yoshinobu died , and it was " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA " ( Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) .
In order to show gratitude for the Emperor Meiji , who was the highest rank of the kazoku ( peerage ) and the highest rank of the kazoku ( peerage ) was given to the Emperor Meiji , Yoshinobu left a will to conduct the Shinshiki ( ritual ceremony ) , instead of his own funeral .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was not found in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Zojo - ji Temple , which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family , but a round barrow similar to that of the Imperial family was built in Tanaka Cemetery .
This is because the Emperor Komei was a good imperial mausoleum , so he was impressed by the Emperor Komei ( " Tokawa Yoshinobu no Konden " [ biography of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ] ) .
When Yoshinobu was pardoned , he wrote that he was a roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) Katsukiyo ITAKURA , who was a member of the shogun 's council of elders who wanted to give his life to the former shogun 's retainers who had offered his life for his life , and then he said that he would have been in love with Yoshinobu .
In the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , there was a weak image of ' enemy escape ' in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , but after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , it has been reevaluated in recent years and has been reviewed by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Taiga drama ) .
As with his father , Nariaki , he was fond of pork in the Satsuma Domain , and he was called ' Buda Ichi - sama ' or ' Ichiba - sama ' ( a kind of pork and pork are fond of meat ) .
In his later years , he loved bread and milk , and when he was a shogun in his later years , he had a hobbies such as photographing , fishing and fishing , bicycle carp , bracking , and handicraft , he seemed to have learned French language from Zhou Xianzhou .
It is famous as a camera many , but it seems that the technique of camera filming was not progressed .
He often wrote photographic magazine , but it is said that he did not adopt it .
In addition , his great - grandson Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA was a cameraman , and his photograph was discovered by Yoshinobu and published by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA , including the filming of Yoshinobu was discovered and published by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA .
He was a friend of his hobbies and was a younger brother of Akitake TOKUGAWA .

The entire line is included in the suburbs of large cities .
Since the Kansai Main Line has its origin as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , the official starting point is Kizu Station , but the train runs from Kyoto to Kizu ( the number of the train numbers ) , and the inbound train is the same as that of the train number .
Except for the following routes , it will be described in the section from Kyoto to Kizu .
The color of the line is brown ( ? ) , and it is said that the reason for the selection is that ' two ancient capitals of Japan are the image of the past . '

The Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) except Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) ( Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) .
Although the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line , the entire section is located in Kyoto Prefecture , and there is no railway line in Nara Prefecture .
Although the Nara Railway was originally constructed by Nara Railway , the line between Kyoto and Nara was split into a part of the Kansai Railway Company ; after it was merged into the Kansai Railway Company , it was separated from Osaka and Nagoya as a part of the Nagoya Route .
However , trains are operated from Kizu Station to the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) , while Nara Station is operated by Nara Station .
JR West announced the nickname of the line in each line of the Urban Network on March 13 , 1988 , but the Nara Line was sent to see the Nara Line .
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is located on the Kintetsu Nara Line , it is sometimes referred to as ' JR Nara Line . '
In the era of Japan National Railways ( JNR ) , the name ' JNR Nara Line ' was used as a guide and the English character of the board was also written as ' JR . '
The Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Naniwa , Nara and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , which is in rivalry with the JR Nara Line .
While the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel with many trains , the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 when JNR was electrified , and only the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 105 , which was operated by JNR JNR JNR Series 105 , was operated by a small local line .
However , after JR West was inaugurated , the train was reorganized into four - car trains in the Urban Network Network , and the increase of rapid trains such as ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was rapidly improved by increasing the number of trains such as ' Miyakoji Rapid Service . '
At present , it has a strong nature as a commuting or a route of the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Byodo - in Temple in Uji City , where Uji City is located along the line , and Joyo City , where it is located along the street .
However , it is a circular shape on the east side of the Momoyama - Nitta section , and the section south of Joyo Station is located in parallel with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line running in parallel with the central part of the town , and the transportation of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line is still different .
Although the trains of Nara Train Depot are used for Nara Train Depot of the Osaka branch station , the station is managed by Kyoto Branch except for Kizu Station .
The J - Thru ICOCA , ICOCA , and the Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA and KANSAI THRU PARU PASS can be used at all stations .
In the south of Joyo Station , the station is a simple ticket gate that is operated by Mujin Station .
In 1984 , the limited express ' Kuroshio ' operated between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station was abolished by the Nara Line , Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line , and until 1991 , only local trains were operated as local trains until 1991 , but nowadays there were four types of local trains that were operated between Miyakoji Station and Rapid trains , Rapid trains , Rapid and local trains that were operated between Kyoto and Wakayama .
It is the nearest type of the Nara Line , and is mainly operated during the daytime mainly during the daytime .
Basically , a local train connects with a local train at Uji Station with a local train and a local train at Uji Station .
The nickname of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was decided by the public before the operation started .
Many of the trains that connect Kyoto and Nara , which are tourist spots , use not only Japanese but also foreigners , but also for tourists .
All the trains are operated in the JR West Series 221 and are operated with four - car trains or six cars .
The maximum speed of the double - track section is 110 km / h and the maximum speed is operated at 110 km / h , and the speed is 95 km / h other than that is 95 km / h.
Approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara , and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Nara .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamitakoma Station or Tanakura Station in the middle of the station , and there are some differences between the inbound and outbound trains that go to Nara because they are different from the Nara no Miyakoji rapid train .
During the three days of the new year , Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station in order to visit Fushimi Inari Station .
History
March 3 , 2001 : The operation began operating .
March 15 , 2003 : Due to the revision of the timetable revision , the station began to stop at Tofukuji Station and Tamamizu Station .
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours .
It is also operated by JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) that stop ' Miyakoji Rapid Service . '
All trains are operated in the Series 221 and are operated with four - car trains or six cars .
Basically , a local train connects with a local train at Uji Station with a local train and a local train at Uji Station .
In the same way as the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above , the Yamatoji Line rapid trains stop at Hirayama Station , which is operated by the Yamatoji Line .
The stops of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' were used until March 2001 when ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was introduced , and JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 was used in Kyoto and Uji and Joyo ( initially stopping at the station ) and Kizu and Nara , but after that the Nara Line has not been used for the Nara Line .
In the morning and evening , there is a train that directly connects the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line .
It is mainly operated in the morning and night .
It was originally a weekday , but was operated only on Saturday and holidays due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 18 , 2006 .
Although trains stop at each station between Uji Station and Nara Station , there was a rapid train bound for Kizu Station in the vicinity of midnight due to the difference between the local trains running at Uji Station and the local trains running at Uji Station , but nowadays the local trains that run before the local rapid train stopped at this station .
There are some trains that use JNR 103 series JNR 103 from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays , and all trains are operated on the 221 series 21 .
During the morning rush hour there is a train that runs directly from the Yamatoji Line because it is convenient .
Rapid trains on the Nara Line were used as a line line for preventing mistakes with rapid trains in the Yamatoji Line , but due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 2008 , the type of local rapid trains in the section was used as a greenish color due to the changes of the rollsign of the rollsign of the timetable revision of March 2008 .
In the postmark of the station in the north of Kamikoma Station , it is described as a purple letter .
It runs between Kyoto Station and Uji , Joyo and Nara Station .
During the daytime the section between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station runs every 15 minutes , but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu , between Joyo Station and Kizu Station is 30 - minute interval .
Basically , trains are operated in the 103 series cars , but some of them are operated in the 2221 series cars .
In the early morning and late evening , there are trains that directly connect the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late evening .
In the past , there was a direct train with the Sakurai Line , but on September 4 , 1994 the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two routes .
Although it was a special train , limited express trains were sometimes operated on the Nara Line .
From 1987 to 1988 , the name ' Kuroshi ( train ) ' was changed from 1987 to 1989 by the nickname of ' Kuroshi ( train ) ' to Hakuhama Station on the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line and the Hanwa Line via the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line .
In the Kinki Shinbun Newspaper published on January 6 , 1998 , there was an announcement that a limited express train would run on the Nara Line with 381 series of limited express trains on the Nara Line ( commuter train ) , but the plan was stopped after that .
Although it was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station as the Miyakoji Rard , the direct trains to the Sakurai Line were operated between Kyoto Station and Nara Station ( Miyakoji Rapid Service between Nara and Nara ) , but no direct trains to the Sakurai Line are operated at present .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Fireworks held at the nearest station to Uji Station , but the trains are operated only for local trains from 16:00 a.m. to the final timetable , and the trains between Kyoto and Uji are operated between Kyoto and Uji only 10 minutes .
There are some local trains that arrive at and depart from Kizu Station .
The special schedule of the New Year 's Day at that time became completely different and Rapid trains stopped at each station between Kyoto and Uji Station , and the number of trains was increased to the Uji Station .
Depending on the year , there were some trains that came back to Momoyama Station .
In 1992 , direct trains bound for the Sakurai Line were extended to a rapid train on Saturdays and holidays mainly on Saturdays and holidays , and one hour was operated between Tenri Station and Tenri Station .
In addition , special trains that are operated by the group are available throughout Japan .
Particularly , when the Tenri Religious Festival held every October 26 , the trains called ' special trains for the Tenri Line ' are operated between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station on the Nara Line and the Yamatoji Line between Nara Station and Nara Station and Sakurai Line .
All of them belonged to Nara Train Depot .

Keiji Bypass is a bypass of National Highway Route from Kusatsu City , Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama - cho , Kuse - gun , Kyoto Prefecture .
It is designated as a plan for regional high - standard roads
The following is the section on the Keiji Bypass of the Uryo Road and the Keiji Bypass of National Route 1 and National Route 24 .
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway and is connected with the Kuridashi Interchange of the Meishin Expressway , the Kyoto City City area and the direction of the city of Kyoto City , the Kuritashi Interchange and the Suita Interchange of Nagoya City and Osaka City .
By the law , the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama Yodo Interchange are designated as National Highway Route 1 and National Route 478 , and the Kumiyama Interchange ( Keiji Bypass ) , the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange and Oyamazaki Junction , which are designated by the Minister of the National Highway 478 and National Highway Route 478 , and the Taki Expressway ( special road for the National Highway Highway Expressway ) , the National Highway Route No . 478 and the National Highway Highway Road ( Keiji Bypass of Kyoto Prefectural Road No . 2 , the Kyoto Prefectural Road No . 2 and the Keiji Interchange of the Yodo Interchange of the National Highway Highway and the National Route , the National Highway Highway Route 2 and the Yodo Interchange of the National Highway Highway Highway Route of the Kusatsu Expressway .
As the plan was planned later , the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway was built in order to improve the delay of the Meishin Expressway , the Kyoto Municipal radiation and the construction of a road that had functions as a bicycle of Kyoto City , and the construction of a road connecting the Kyoto Tanba Road and the Keiji Bypass which was a bypass of National Highway Route 9 as well as the National Highway 9 Bypass .
The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway have been designated National Highway 478 and has been maintained consistently .
According to the indication of the line , it is considered to be a Keiji Bypass in the Seta JC - TT , and it is considered to be a Keiji Bypass in Oyamazaki JC .
Also , the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass are different from the ETC system , although there are differences between the fee and the ETC system .
When there is no special note , the Keiji Bypass ( from the Seta Higashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki JCT ) is described as the name of the business route .

( In addition , the section under the management of the Ibaraki Management Office is included in the section between Kyoto Higashi Interchange and Suita JC , the Daini Keihan - do Road and the Keiwa Jidoshado Expressway . )
August 29 , 1988 : The Seta Higashi Interchange and JCT - JC - JC - JT - CT / Ogura - Interchange were opened .
March 30 , 2003 : The Ogura - Interchange - Kumiyama JC - T - TS opened .

The Uji Tunnel is the longest 4,313 meters in the National Route 1 , and the tunnels are prohibited except for 500 meters in front of the Uji - higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange .
Before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction , the film was filmed in the film " Dancing for dancing , EM , EV II " before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction .
When the distance between Seta Interchange and Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT , the Keiji Bypass is shorter than the Meishin Expressway , the Keiji Bypass is more shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and when it runs on the maximum speed of the maximum speed of the station , the Keiji Bypass runs earlier than the Keiji Bypass via the Keiji Bypass .
Since there are no resting facilities such as the service area , the Meishin Expressway is often crowded with the congestion of the Meishin Expressway , and the rest of the rest of the Meishin Expressway is the Otsu Service Area , and the Katsuragawa Park .
However , the structure of both the Seta and Oyamazaki Junction , which was established after the name of the god , is a very complicated structure ( especially the structure of the JCTTT of Oyamazaki JCT , which is a very complicated structure , has a complicated structure , is the same as that of the road that is operated in a parallel .
When you go from Oyamazaki JTT to Suita and Osaka from the Oyamazaki JT , there is an inconvenience that you can get along the Meishin Expressway and the left side of the Meishin Expressway .
In addition , since the curve and the sloping road have continued , there are quite a few passages to respect them , so it does not function as a bypass of the Meishin Expressway because it is a bypass of Meishin Expressway .
Since this road is a bypass of National Route 1 ( general national road ) , it is an exclusive road for motorcycles , and is not a highway for high - speed Expressway .
When you pass the Keiji Bypass from the east side of the Uji - gawa River , you must pass through the Uji Nishi Interchange when you pass the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is the Harff IC of the Uji - higashi Interchange .
For this reason , the general road section between the Uji Higashi Interchange and the Uji Nishi Interchange is often traffic during the time of commution .
This general road section is located in the direction of the VISR , so it is difficult to measure the traffic delay .

It is one of the deities that deify the sun and are considered to be one of the deities of the Imperial family .
In the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it is written as 天照大神神 ( 天照大神 ) in the Kojiki ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , and in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , it is written as 天下神神 , and it is written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
He was also called Ohirume no Muchi no Kami .
In the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , several gods were described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , but in the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it was unified by the name of the god called ' Tensho Daijin ' in the name of the god .
Although she was a goddess , there is a theory that she was actually a male god .
Since the name of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as " Kotai Jingu Gishiki , " it is said that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and became the ancestor of the Imperial family .
In the Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amazume no Okami or Sumeramikami , or when the name of the god is enshrined before the festival , it is also referred to as Amateruimasu no kami or Amenosakasume - no - kami when the god is enshrined .
In academic documents today , the word ' Amaterasu ' and katakana are used as a custom .
There is also a theory that it was written as 天照太神 .
Description in mythology
According to the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , when Izanagi came back from the land of Izanami , he was born when he washed off the impurities of the dead and washed his left eyes .
He was born from the right eye and was called Miki no Miko , together with Susanoo who was born from the nose .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to govern Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susanoo who was entrusted to Kaibara continued to cry that he would go to Nenokuni where Izanami had lived , so he was expelled by Izanami .
Susanoo met his older sister , Amaterasu Omikami , before he went to Nenokuni ( the Nine Kingdom ) , and he went to Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , but Amateru Oomikami thought that his younger brother would take over Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) and waited for him .
In order to prove the purity of Susanoo , the three goddesses were born from the real reality of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to the five pillars , and Susanoo declared the victory .
He was born from the real power of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and was regarded as a child of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and the following five deities are deities of the following five gods .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Hikutsuhikone
Kusunokuten
Susano who was frightened by this , worked hard in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amaterasu Omikami hid herself in Ama no Iwato ( heavenly rock cave ) .
In the middle of the world , there were various misfortunes in the world .
( The eight hundred million deities including Yagorogi no mikoto and Amenokoyane no mikoto succeeded in making Amaterasu Omikami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , and so on , and Susanoo was expelled from Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
He sent his son Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) .
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) was pacified , Amenooshihomimi descended after Ninigi was born , and Ninigi descended from his grandson Ninigi .
interpretation
In the mythology , Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be the god of the nation because he was born earlier than that of Amatsu kami ( Takamimusubi ) ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) who was born earlier than him , and in some cases , there is a scene where Amaterasu Omikami was in accordance with the instructions of the god .
There is also a view that the shrine was deified as a god of ancient shrine maidens .
It is also called ' 日女女 ' ( 日女女 ) and refers to miko ( a shrine maiden ) who served the sun god .
The sun god was originally a male god , but there is a theory that the shrine maiden who served was identified with the sun god was identified with the sun god and became a goddess .
There is also a theory that this goddess was established in the era of Empress Jito , who was a female emperor , and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
It is pointed out that the birth of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukuyomi ( Tsukuyomi or Tsukuyomi no kami ) was based on the Taoist Buddhist scriptures and the " Ryoho Gofu " ( before the sixth century ) , and in the " Ryoho Gofu " ( before the sixth century ) , it is pointed out that it was strongly influenced by Taoism .
In addition , the belief that Ise - jingu Shrine enshrines Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Saigu , the Saigu , the Saikan , the Saikan , the Saikan , the Saikan , the Shigi no Miya , the Shimo no Miyatsuko , the Miginu ( purification ) , and Usuku ( white silk fabric ) of the five colors are divided into two types , and the Taoist theory is that the term of Ojingu Shrine and Ojingu Shrine is consistent .
According to comparative mythology , the birth mythology of Amaterasu Omikami was almost equal to that of the ancient mythological mythology which records the ancient period ( 3 to 4 centuries ) , which was recorded earlier than the ancient times .
Also , there is a theory that it is considered that both the sun and the sun , because it spread to Japan along with the ethnic groups in the earlier history .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the shrine was transformed into three steps .
The following are the events and contents of the movement .
645 : Taika Reforms
Before that , the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
" Hijin no kami " ( 日神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) (
A male god called ' Ameru , ' was widely enshrined there .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines such as ' Akamasu - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima , ' Issunimasu Amateru ' in Harima , and ' Ameteru ' in Tanba .
The term " Otoko - kama " is also used as the name of Amenohoakari , a grandson of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and Amenohoakari is also the founder of the Owari clan , the Tsunamori clan , and the Kaibe clan .
The younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi and the great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : The Jinshin War
Ohihirume no Muchi no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Muchime ' is a ' Matsumi no Kami ' ( Woman of the sun goddess ) or ' Tanatatsume ' ( Tanatatsume ) .
In this case , the enshrined deity is interpreted as Ohirume no Sumeramikoto , who is a goddess , and there is an interpretation that it is the ' ameteru ' of a snake .
698 : Kotai - jingu Shrine was established .
Amaterasu ( the Sun Goddess ) and ' the ancestor of the Imperial family . '
She was a goddess .
Emperor Jito was modeled after the Emperor Jito , and it was created from a natural god to a humanity god .
Even after that , the term ' Tenteru ' other than Koto - shin was called ' Ama no teru . '
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( Tarashina Diary ) , it is written as ' 天照御神 ' ( 1060 ) , and ' 天照神 ' ( 天照神 ) is also read as ' ameru , ' and also in ' Amatsuhirume ' in " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
1880 - 1881 , a fierce controversy occurred over the enshrined deities of Shinto Jimukyoku ( Bureau of Divination ) in Hibiya , Tokyo .
The Shinto Jimukyoku insisted that the three deities were enshrined as the enshrined deities of the Bureau of Divinities ( Amenominakanushi no Kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Kamimusubi no kami ) , and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) should be enshrined in this world , but the Izumo school should be integrated into ' Yuikai ' ( the world ) .
However , the ' Ise school ' which was the center of the Shinto Jimukyoku was the ' presidence ' that Amaterasu Omikami was the ' presidence ' that ruled the two worlds of Kenyu and the other gods insisted that the other gods were not a subject .
In the end , there were various views such as ' As the Izumo school had a grudge that had continued since the age of the god ' and ' the Imperial family should kill Senke Sonfuku , who had a bad mind in the Imperial family . '
Before long , the controversy was taken over by Emperor Meiji 's decision , and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was ranked as the highest rank .
In addition , it is said that the government recognized that the modern nation directly controlled the people through the Fukushin Shinto .
Refer to the controversy of the enshrined deities of State Shinto Jimukyoku ( the Bureau of Shinto Shrines ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA introduced Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) in his own novel to his own novel , and he used another name ' Ohirume no Sumeru ' ( also known as Ohirume no Ki ) .
This is because the term ' Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) ' does not appear in the word ' 大日日日日hirume no Ki ' because the word ' 大日日日比売神 ' was used in the form of the sun god or natural god .
In fact , there are many novels written by AKUTAGAWA who were not able to revise the corrections of the army and copying the scandal of the army ; they were not able to do so .
In 1926 , Masaatsu YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who established the Kinkei Gakuin School ( 1926 - 1983 ) , said , ' Japan has the belief of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is the ideal to make the world light of Japanese spirit .
The word ' Izana ' in Izanagi and Izanagi 's words means ' a world 's awakening , a pioneer of the world , ' and if a person who becomes an editor .

Daimyo in the Edo period
The daimyo in the Edo period were determined by the social standing of social standing and official ranks , and the rank was determined according to kakaku ( family status ) and kokudaka ( crop yield ) of kokudaka ( crop yield ) and shikoseki ( family status of a daimyo in the Edo period ) in the Edo period .
Firstly , due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family , it was classified as a tozama daimyo ( tozama daimyo who became vassals of the Tokugawa family ) , mainly fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who was a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara , mainly became a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara .
In the case of the extinction of the Shogun family , Ieyasu established the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) which were allowed to use the Tokugawa family as well as the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) as the Shogun family and was allowed to use the surname of the Tokugawa family as well as the Tokugawa family , and the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA , the Owari Domain and the 10th son of Yorinobu TOKUGAWA were appointed to the Mito Domain .
In addition , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to the Echizen Domain and a daimyo ( feudal lord ) of the Tokugawa clan throughout the country .
In addition , the fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who had established the foundation of the Tokugawa Shogun family were placed as Fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and also held important posts centered on roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) at the beginning of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and assisted the shogunate government .
Although the Ii clan , the head of fudai daimyo ( fudai daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) of the Ii clan , had a large amount of fief of 50,000 koku , the Torii clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , and the Ogasawara clan had a relatively large amount of rice for more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period , the Sakai clan , the Abe clan , the Abe clan , the Horiizawa clan , the Yanagimoto clan , and so on , and only a few fudai daimyo who maintained more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period .

In extreme cases , one village was divided into other feudal lords and governed one village ( shokyu [ salary ] ) .
Although daimyo were more than 10,000 koku ( crop yields ) , the Kiregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was worth 5,000 koku .
This was because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan .
