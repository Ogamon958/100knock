Even if it was not completed by a certain level of time , even if it became a Buddha , even if it became a Buddha , it was a true practice to keep the ascetic practices of Buddha in order to be a Buddha ( Shugosho Ichinyo , the true nature of the Buddha ) , and that it was the ultimate practice of sitting meditation .
Many of the Kamakura Bukkyo are aware of the Mappo - shiso ( theory of the end of the world ) , but it is not completely different from the fact that the book was written in the record of the Shosobogenzo - ki ( record of the records of the Buddhist Statues ) .
It is a convenient for a period of time in which a statue is placed at the end of the statue of Zo - matsu .
The true teaching of Sanezane is not accepted .
It should be interpreted as " yorisen . "
He was not always victorious in his lifetime .
There is also an inevitable decision , such as the Asama shikimen ( deep deep interest ) , and the Shimotane ( lower root of the mind ) .
The precepts of Buddhism and various kinds of Buddhist precepts are given to all living things and the people who are in charge of the precepts .
It is the opportunity for all people to be a Buddha .
He thought that he could not always be able to be a person who was a disciple of Shaka , and he pointed out that he could not be a person who was a disciple of Shakyamuni , and he denied the Mappo ( end of the world ) which was just a convenient preaching .

The former Nijo station building was built in 1904 , with the oldest two - story Japanese building in which the Kyoto Railway Company ( JR West ) was constructed as well as the main shrine , and it was designed to imitate Heian - jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape .
Although the Kyoto Railway was nationally nationalized in 1907 , it was used as the station building of JR West , and after that , in 1996 , the Sanin Main Line between Nijo Station and Hanazono Station on the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) , the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) , the station building was reconstructed , and the station building was reconstructed in 1997 , and the interior of the station building was used as a relay site of the station building .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
The Ogata Kuri has 16 domestic steam locomotives produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period , and 16 types of domestic steam locomotives ( 16 ryo at the beginning of the opening ) which have been produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period are displayed .
At the beginning of the opening , two cars of C53 cars and C51 No.51 were registered in the Ministry of C53 and 239 ; however , there are seven cars that have been preserved .
Among the five cars , the five cars are still registered at present , and the ' Yamaguchi ' and the ' Kitabiko ( train ) ' of the Yamaguchi Line are served on the Tokaido Main Line , such as the ' Yamaguchi ' and the ' Hokuriku Main Line ' respectively .
Although the motoration machine other than these two cars is not available , it can not be carried out on the Tokaido Main Line because there are no inspection in all directions .
In addition , the ' SL Squart ' is operated by the track of the railway in the vicinity of the museum .
Although this exhibition line was once located north from the depot to the north of the current large - size parking park , it was changed to the north of the site where the current large - size bicycle parking facilities were located in the north of the former Nijo Station and the current location of the station building was moved to the south of the former Nijo Station and the current Umekoji Park was located in the vicinity of the former Nijo Station and the south end of the current Umekoji Park was changed to the Sagano Line .
Even now , it has functions as an institution and is also connected to the business route .

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music .
It is a religious music used for rituals and ceremonies .
In Japan , it is also called Babai or Bonbogu .
In the old style , it was written as myo .

Gogyo refers to five kinds of vocational schools , such as Shomyo ( learning of phonology and gramm ) , Kyoryo ( technology ) , Kyoryo ( study of techniques and technics ) , Iho ( medical science ) , Inmei ( ethic ) , Naimei ( learning of one 's own sect ) , and Naimei ( Buddhists ) .
It has been handed down along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan .
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in 754 during the Buddhist memorial service held at the Great Buddha of Todai - ji Temple , and it is believed that Shomyo was popular in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai passed the voice and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo .
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect have their own voices and still have been handed down to this day .
In order to pass down the oral tradition of kuden , there were no gakufu ( musical instruments ) .
As a result , the denju became difficult .
Later , hakase , who was a gakufu ( musical instrument ) , was invented .
There are differences in terms of specialized terms such as hakase depending on each school .
However , Hakase is a reference , and if they practice Shomyo ( Shomyo ) , they are required to teach Shomyo ( Shomyo ( Shomyo ) , they are required to keep and inherit the school from the master to their disciples .
For this reason , the training of the leaders and successors was required .

Before long , the two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the dojo for Shomyo of the Ohara school .
In addition , Jakurehara later formed a group , and in Ohara there was a voice of two branches .
Later , Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo .
Tanchi built a new theory based on the theory of music .
Since then , the center of the Tendai Shomyo sect has been handed down to the current Tendai Shomyo .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu , Jodoshu sect , Jodo Shinshu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect Shomyo are descended from the Tendai Shomyo sect .
Shingon - Shomyo is the basis of the transmission by Kukai and has been handed down to the present day .
It has been after the Shinga period when Shomyo has been systematized .
Kancho can be said to be the restorer of the family .
He worked as a composer and improvement of Shomyo .

The Honsoin school and the Shinkoin - ryu and Daigo schools were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
At present , it is divided into Chizan ( Chishaku - in Temple , Kyoto , Chishaku - in Temple ) , Buzan ( Mt. Buzan ) and Nanzan Shinryu ( Nanzan school , Mt. Koya , Kyoto and Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The Ryomei school originated from the Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo ( Shomyo Shomyo of Shingi Shingon sect ) , the Chizan school of the Shingon sect and the Buzan school of the Shingon sect and the Fuyo school originated from the Nakagawa Daishin school .

The characteristic is that it is called ' ronron ' ( 論論論 ) of Mt. Toyama , ' ron ' ( 論論論 ) and ' shomyo ' ( 明明 ) of Mt. Chizan .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school of the Nanzan Shingon - shu sect ( Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect ) was the origin of the Nakagawa school .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa Temple in Nara Prefecture .

Nagatsuyama and the mountain where there is no time to be dead . '
It is one of the mysteries of politics in the middle of the seventh century , when Emperor Tenchi did not ascend the throne for a long time and was not enthroned .
There are several theories about this theory .
This is the consideration for the power of the Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , Emperor Tenmu , who is believed to have been a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , is wrong , and it is based on the theory that Emperor Tenmu was born before Emperor Kogyoku got married to Emperor Jomei , and that he was an older brother of Emperor Tenchi .
It is certain that the year of Emperor Tenmu was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) and some history books of the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) at the age of the Emperor Tenmu , and Emperor Tenmu became the longer .
However , there are no contradictions in the same historical material , and there are many historical materials that contain the difference between the age of 8 and 99 .
On the other hand , there is an opinion that " although the father is different , the younger brother is bad and the younger brother is the same as that of Heaven , but the age of Tenchi 's father Emperor Jomei was different from the age when the Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the year of his birth is 614 , which is the year of the birth of the Emperor Honcho was adopted , and it is said that he was born in 614 .
There was a counterargument that " Koji " was not rare in ancient times , and Tenchi and Minto , who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu 's reign , held the Shosei system and did not ascend the throne .
It is said that there was a mistake in order to avoid mistake .
There is also a theory that it is pointed out that other history books which have been pointed out as ' Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) ' are different from the fact that they were compiled in the same period as the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) are not treated as the same .
( Also refer to the article on the age of Emperor Tenmu . )
It is said that the Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat caused by Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Naka no Oe was expelled from the position .
Recently , it has been pointed out that the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good and the basic policy is similar to that of the policy .
When Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji ( Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji who was in charge of killing Iruka at the same time ) .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) there is a theory that this theory was based on the fact that it was changed to the Taika Reforms .
In this theory , the reason for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka could not be expelled after the coup d'etat and other doubts can be explained as well .
There is a theory that the enthronement of the Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to opposition from the relationship between the women of the Emperor Tenchi .
It is said that Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , showed the relationship between her and Tenchi in the poem that she was a wife of the Emperor and a daughter of the same mother of the Emperor Tenchi .
Although the love and marriage between her half brother and sisters were allowed to be forgiven , she was actually in love with the older brother of the same mother , but it was interpreted that she was in fact involved in the relationship between her uncle , Michiko TONAKA and the Emperor Kotoku , and even after she got married to her older brother , Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
After the death of Empress Saimei , the Imperial Princess Hashihito succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous Emperor , but there is a theory that the records were lost due to some circumstances .
In " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) , there is a theory that the Emperor came from the theory that he was a princess , and it can be interpreted that the term ' Chuko no Mikoto ' can be interpreted as the Emperor who succeeded to the throne until the enthronement of Emperor Tenji .
If Hashihito no Himemiko = ' Naka no Mikoto , ' it can be said that the reason why she had to be called ' Nakanomikoto , ' but there is a theory that Empress Saimei was not certain .
Although it is difficult to prove the nature of political history and historical materials , it is difficult to prove it , and the study of research has been progressed , including the cooperation of archaeologists and so on .
Poems
He was also a waka poet of Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) that four poems were handed down to Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) .
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu ( the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems in the Heian period , the following poem is included in the beginning of the poem .

The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane .
Since Michisue 's great - grandchild Kintsune SAIONJI had a niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo as his wife , he was caught by the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and was confined to the Imperial Court , and after the Jokyu War , he was trusted by the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , he gained the power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi ( liaison of the Kanto region ) and gained the social status of Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) .
The name of the Saionji family comes from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his villa in Kyoto ( Kitayama - mura , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono , and the current Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA by the Saionji family .
After Kintsune , he was supported by the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and in the Kamakura period , he also gained the power of Sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) .
Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) , and he put his daughter to the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
However , after his son , Kinhira SAIONJI , the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) came to have a distance from the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and he supported the Jimyoin line and deepened the confrontation with Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) .
After that , when Kinmune SAIONJI died , the Kamakura bakufu fell , and he was dismissed from the position of Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO , who was a remnant of the Hojo clan , and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration , and planned to install the Retired Emperor Go - Fushimi , and Kinmune was arrested due to the betrayal of his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI who was a younger brother of the Jimyoin line .
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Sanetoshi SAIONJI who was a son of Kinmune served the Northern Court , served as Udaijin ( minister of the right ) and restored the family name .
During the Muromachi period and the Edo period , he was also known as a family of biwa ( Japanese lute ) .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime who was the eldest daughter of Tadataka HOSOKAWA ( later disinherited later ) ) , who was the heir of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later became disinherited ) and was appointed to Sadaijin ( Minister of the Left ) , but Kyumu NAGAOKA donated 600 koku ( crop yields ) to the Saionji family and donated 600 koku ( crop yields ) .
In the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted by the Tokudaiji family of the Kanin school , and after the Meiji Restoration , he was active as a politician , and he became a Genro ( elder statesman ) in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods .
Although Kinmochi , who was a family business of the Saionji family , was suffering from the fact that he was said to be a bad play by Emperor Meiji during his prime minister , he was said to be ' a biwa player of the Saionji family , ' and he was in charge of gagaku ( ancient Japanese court dance and music ) music and biwa biwa ( Japanese lute ) in the Imperial Household Ministry of the Imperial Household with the members of the Department of the Imperial Household and the biwa biwa ( Japanese lute ) .

He was the only shogun who did not attend the duties of the shogun in the Edo - jo Castle .
He was the Naidaijin ( the Minister of the Interior ) , Juichii ( Junior First Rank ) and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun .
He was a member of the House of Peers ( Japan ) .
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , who served as a guardian , he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
After Emperor Meiji returned to the government of the Emperor Meiji (= Taisei Hokan [ transfer of power back to the emperor ] ) , he tried to reconcile with the Imperial Court but in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , he returned from Osaka - jo Castle to the Edo Castle while he left the former Shogunate army after the Restoration of Imperial Rule and returned to the Edo - jo Castle , and he was ordered to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court , and he was forced to surrender the castle .
In the Meiji period , he died of his hobbies and lived as a duke until the Taisho period .
Yoshinobu ' is also read as ' Yoshinobu ' or ' Keiki ' as a common name .
There is a record that ' Yoshihisa ' was read as ' Yoshihisa ' in the official documents issued by the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
His name is also written as ' Yokosei , ' or in the English newspapers that he signed the alphabet and signed the English dialect .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' Yoshinobu ' but in Shizuoka City , where he lived there is often called ' Keiki . '
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu during his lifetime , Yoshinobu seemed to be fond of ' Keiki - sama , ' and he called himself ' Keiki ' in the telephone of his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA , who was the successor of Yoshinobu , was also called ' Keyu sama ' by people around him .
The two names of ' Kiki - sama ' and ' Keijiki - san ' can be found in modern times , but the names of ' Keisan - san ' can be found not only in Shizuoka but are often found in various places , and in either case , ' Keisan - san ' is often used to be used as a " very close relative . "
Ryotaro SHIBA , who was referred to as a former retainer of the shogunate , said ' many people were related to the former retainers of the shogunate , but it can be said that they were deeply respected in the broad area because they were able to be used by those involved in the Higo Domain who had been involved in the overthrow of the Shogunate .
On October 29 , 1837 , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was Princess Yoshiko ( the third shogun , Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) , who became the legal wife of the legal wife of the Shogun after the death of the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is said to be Oe no kata , who was the lawful wife of his father , Hidetada , but there is a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was Shichiromaro .
In accordance with the educational policy of Nariaki , he moved to the Mito Domain for seven months after his birth , and he was taught academics and martial arts by Shosai ISAWA , who had inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family .
Yoshinobu seemed to have attracted attention from those days , and Nariaki thought that Nariaki was not adopted by other families at first , and he thought that he did not have any adopted son to other families , and he thought that he was allowed to remain in his hands as a hikan ( waiting for his eldest son and legitimate son ) of his eldest son Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered Shichiromaro from the Mito Domain to become the heir of the Hitotsubashi family of Gosankyo ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) .
After that , Shichiromaro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December he was given the name of Yoshinobu by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence and thought that Yoshinobu was a powerful candidate for the successor of the shogun , but he gave up the proposal of Masahiro ABE , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) .
In 1853 , during the chaos of the arrival of the Black Ships , Shogun Ieyoshi died of illness and the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA did not have a son in poor health and had a problem that ' the heir would be the heir of the shogun . '
Nariaki ABE , the lord of the Satsuma Domain , Nariakira SHIMAZU , and the lord of the Kishu Domain , Naosuke II , the lord of the Hikone Domain and the real mother of Iesada 's mother , Honjuin .
The Hitotsubashi school tried to put Tenshoin as the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU 's adopted daughter , Tenshoin into O - oku ( inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside ) , but after the death of Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU , Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister ) and became Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 .
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan .
Yoshinobu went to Fujiki - jo Castle with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of the Fukui Domain , but on the other hand , he was accused of Naosuke 's crime and was confined to retirement in 1859 ( the Ansei no Taigoku [ suppression of extremists by the Shogun ] ) .
It is said that Yoshinobu did not want to become the heir of the shogun , but he sent a letter from Nariaki to Nariaki because he failed to do so .
In 1860 , he was suspended from confinement .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy Shigenori OHARA was guarded by the Satsuma army led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , and the Emperor Komei issued an imperial order to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as a guardian , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA ) to become Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On July 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu to the position of Shogun and Shungaku to the position of Seiji sosai .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku did not carry out the reform of the shogunate called Bunkyu Reforms , and established the Kyoto Shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) and relied on Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as the pioneer of the Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court who was in charge of the expulsion of foreigners .
When the Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , Iemochi was unable to decide the expulsion of foreigners from the emperor and ordered Iemochi to have an audience with Iemochi , who was called ' fictitious illness . '
After the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners ) led by the Choshu clan was expelled due to the Coup of August 18 ( old lunar calendar ) , he went back to Kyoto again to participate in the council of councilors led by the Kobu - gattai ( integration of the imperial court and the shogunate ) and the Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate ) .
However , it can be said that the meeting was not accepted , and it can be said that he was drunk in the sake seats of the Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko and defeated Munenari DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , who were staying in the palace , and also asked NAKAGAWA to discuss the situation that he could not be able to do so as to break down the situation .
After that , he was appointed to the governor of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto , Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Aizu Domain ) , the lord of the Aizu Domain , and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Kuwana Domain ) , who held the position of Shugoshiki ( military governor ) and Shugoshiki ( military governor of the Imperial Court , and he was in charge of controlling the royalists and court nobles ( Ichikai - bashi Bridge and Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA and other vassals of the Mito Domain , who supported Yoshinobu , showed the coolness of his family and vassals of the Mito Domain .
In 1864 , he commanded the bakufu army in the Kinmon Incident , and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of Choshu , he worked hard for the Imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce which had been without imperial sanction and succeeded in obtaining the Imperial sanction from the United States of America and the United States .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an imperial order of conquest of Choshu .
However , the army of the bakufu refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma Domain who had formed the Satsuma - Choshu Alliance , but was defeated .
On July 20 , during the second conquest of Choshu , Shogun Ieshige died in Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu took part in the Imperial Court and succeeded in the conclusion of the Agreement of the war .
Although he was recommended as the successor of Iemochi , Yoshinobu firmly refused it .
On August 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of shogun , but the position of Shogun continued to be rejected .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) asked him to assume the position of shogun , but he did not accept it , and on December 5 , he was appointed as Shogun by the Emperor of the Imperial Court .
In other words , he became a shogun in the form of selling his favor and tried to promote politics to compete with politics .
Yoshinobu was supported by the French minister , Léon LES , and he established the iron office of 240 million dollars from France , and he invited the military advisers such as Julian and Britain to reform the military 's reform .
In addition , he also encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Paris World Exposition , and he encouraged his younger brother European studies .
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port , the Imperial Court was permitted .
Yoshinobu predicted the ' secret imperial decree to overthrow the shogunate from the Satsuma and Choshu , ' and on November 14 , 1867 , he was sent back to the Imperial Court to the Imperial Court and received an imperial sanction ( Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) .
It is said that at that time , the Imperial Court judged that there was no administrative capability , and tried to find the existence of the Tokugawa government under the leadership of the council of feudal lords .
However , due to the plot of Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA , the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December of the same year , Yoshinobu was ordered to ' Jikan nochi ( transfer of the post of Naidaijin and the dedication of the Tokugawa shogunate ) . '
Yoshinobu left the Osaka - jo Castle in order to avoid conflicts , and he advocated the legitimacy of the Tokugawa clan by gathering ministers from foreign countries , and also made the Imperial Court moves the movement to revise the position of Jikan Nos .
However , the following year , 1868 , the Satsuma clan raised an army in the city of Edo , and the soldiers of Aizu , Kuwana Domain were forced to use the soldiers of the Aizu and Kuwana Domains .
However , in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi which broke out on January 3 , when the former Shogunate army was disadvantageous and even though he was still able to maintain his military force , he left the army and retreated to Edo in the military epic " Kaiyo Maru " ( The Battle of Toba - Fushimi ) .
Soon after that , the order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu 's enemy , and the government army led by the Minister of the Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started the expedition to the east .
Yoshinobu insisted on the resistance faction that Tadaosa KOKURI was the first in the beginning of the battle , and insisted on obedience .
In February , Kaishu KATSU appointed Kaishu KATSU to his position and himself was confined in Daiji - in Temple in Ueno Kanei - ji Temple .

As for the study of military arts and academy , he was born in the highest environmental environment , and he was enthusiastic about swordplay from various martial arts .
Even after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he is counted as one of the most famous swordsmiths of the art of swordplay without training on the front side of the back of the whole day .
When his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA was hiding in the barrel , he was just a threat of the barrel , and it is said that the sword was removed from the barrel , when his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA became a problem of the succession of the Tokugawa family .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote that when he became adulthood , he was in the same position as two of his wife and two mistresses in the name of ' Y ' ( Y ) and his three mistress .
Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph in his childhood , but it is doubtful that the photograph of Yoshinobu could not be found in Japan during his childhood .
It is said that he visited Iemochi , who fell ill and fell ill and became popular at that time .
He was known for his bravery , and when he commented that Yoshinobu was a real father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA and Tatewaki YASUSHIMA praised Yoshinobu as ' Kiyomemen no Onihito , ' he was praised as ' Ieyasu TOKUGAWA ' until he took the position of shogun .
Yoshinobu was also aware of the anti - shogunate faction , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan especially said that ' Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI is not an inaccurate tactic of Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI . '
He was cautious about Ieyasu that he would come back again .
When Ryoma SAKAMOTO decided to return to the Imperial Court , Ryoma SAKAMOTO , ' Daini ( Shogun ) ' and the present mind of the present day is considered to be the same .
It is often said that it is necessary to be given to him and it is often given to him .
He made his mind and pledge to give him an appreciation , and Yoshinobu tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser to the new government for the new government .
However , Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was the person who knew the existence of Ryoma after Ryoma 's death ( after Ryoma 's death ) in the Meiji period .
There was no story about Yoshinobu and Ryoma 's acquaintance in his lifetime was very lower than that of the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , and went back to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy .
At that time , Ieyasu forgot the horse seals of gold fans from Ieyasu but he did not forget his favorite concubine , and he was ridiculed for Yoshinobu 's weakness .
However , there is a theory that Yoshinobu needed to oppose armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces , and because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the Imperial Court , he was forced to avoid the intervention of foreign countries , even if he had to protect Osaka - jo Castle in a long - term fight .
It is highly evaluated that the Emperor and the Imperial Court were placed under house arrest in Kanei - ji Temple because they were thought to be an enemy of the new government , and on the other hand , they were thought to be a person who valued the emperor and the Imperial Court ( Mitogaku ( Mitogaku [ Mitogaku [ Mitogaku [ Mitogaku thought of reverence for the Emperor ] and his mother are thought to have been from the Imperial Family ) , but they were not able to show their loyalty to the enemy .
It is highly evaluated that the modern independence of Japan was protected due to the fact that it was close to the unbroken revolutionary revolution , because it was close to the unbroken revolutionary revolution , so that it was a great achievement in the Meiji Restoration .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed to the family head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and after the Meiji Restoration , he had a close relationship with the Meiji Restoration .
In the last days of Yoshinobu , Shibusawa tried to compile the biography of Yoshinobu , and persuaded Yoshinobu , who was astonished and asked him to listen to Naoyoshi 's talent .
The book was compiled in the " " Konjaku Yumeji hikki " ( a record of Yumeji in the past ) .
According to a part of the Dankai , it is written in the form of a meeting , and it can be said that it is a slight voice of Yoshinobu who was an old age .
It can be guessed that he was a man who did not like Hisamitsu SHIMAZU and said , " Hisamitsu SHIMAZU " and " Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who did not like a man who was a person who was a man of the time , so that he was a man who was not a good person .
Based on these materials , the book was completed after Yoshinobu died , and it was " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA " ( Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) .
In order to show gratitude for the Emperor Meiji , who was the highest rank of the kazoku ( peerage ) and was given to the Emperor Meiji , who was given the title of the Emperor 's enemy .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was not found in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Zojo - ji Temple , which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family , and a round barrow similar to that of the Imperial family was built in Tanaka Cemetery .
This is because the Emperor Komei was a good imperial mausoleum , so he was impressed by the Emperor Komei ( " Tokawa Yoshinobu no Konden " [ biography of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ] ) .
When Yoshinobu was pardoned , he wrote that he was a roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) Katsukiyo ITAKURA , who was a member of the shogun 's council of elders who wanted to give his life to the former shogun 's retainers who had offered his own life for his life , and he said that he would have been in love with Yoshinobu .
In the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , there was a weak image of ' enemy escape ' in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , but after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , it has been reevaluated in recent years and has been reviewed by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Taiga drama ) .
As with his father , Nariaki , he was fond of pork in the Satsuma Domain , and he was called ' Buda Ichi - sama ' or ' Ichiba - sama ' ( a kind of pork and pork are fond of meat ) .
In his later years , he was interested in Western literary works , and he was fond of crying and milk , and in his later years , he began to learn French language from the time of the shogun when he was in charge of his hobby such as photographing , fishing and his own camera and his hobbies such as his film , bicycles and bicyclopedia .
It is famous as a camera many , but it seems that the technique of camera filming was not progressed .
He often wrote photographic magazine , but it is said that he did not adopt it .
In addition , his great - grandson Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA was a cameraman , and his photograph was discovered in the house of Yoshinobu and published by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA .
He was a friend of his hobbies and was a younger brother of Akitake TOKUGAWA .
On December 3 , 1854 , he married Mikako ICHIJO ( changed his name to Mikako MIGA after the Meiji Restoration ) .
His first daughter ( Keikoin no ike - ike ike ike ike ike Pond and the present daughter of Odoi Odo ) was born on July 16 , 1851 , but he died young on July 20 .

As the Kansai Main Line has its origin as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , the official starting point is Kizu Station , but the train runs from Kyoto to Kizu ( the number of the train numbers ) , and the inbound train is the same as that of the train number .
Except for the following railway dates , it will be described in the section from Kyoto to Kizu .
The color of the line is brown ( ? ) , and it is said that the reason for the selection is that ' two ancient capitals of the capital . '

The line between Kyoto and Kizu was named the Nara Line , but all sections are located in Kyoto Prefecture , and there are no railway lines in Nara Prefecture .
Although the Nara Railway was originally constructed by Nara Railway , the line between Kyoto and Nara was split into a part of the Kansai Railway Company ; after it was merged into the Kansai Railway Company , it was separated from Osaka and Nagoya as a part of the Nagoya Route .
However , trains are operated from Kizu Station to the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) , while Nara Station is operated by Nara Station .
JR West announced the nickname of the line ( JR Kyoto Line and JR Kobe Line ) in each line of the Urban Network on March 13 , 1988 , but the Nara Line was sent to the Nara Line .
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is located on the Kintetsu Nara Line , it is sometimes referred to as ' JR Nara Line . '
In the era of Japan National Railways ( JNR ) , the name ' JNR Nara Line ' was used as a guide and the English character of the board was also written as ' JR . '
The Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Naniwa , Nara and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , which is in rivalry with the JR Nara Line .
While the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel with many trains , the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 when JNR was electrified , and only the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 105 , which was operated by JNR JNR JNR Series 105 , was operated by a small local line .
However , after JR West was inaugurated , the train was reorganized into four - car trains in the Urban Network network , and the increase of rapid trains such as ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was rapidly improved due to the increase of rapid trains such as ' Miyakoji Rapid Service . '
At present , it has a strong nature as a commuting or a route of the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Byodo - in Temple in Uji City , where Uji City is located along the line , and Joyo City , where it is located along the street .
However , it is a circular shape on the east side of the Momoyama - Shinden section , and in the south of Joyo City , the Kintetsu Kyoto Line runs parallel in parallel with the Kyoto Line running outside the center of the town .
Although the trains of Nara Train Depot are used for Nara Train Depot of the Osaka branch station , the station is managed by Kyoto Branch except for Kizu Station .
The J - Thru ICOCA , ICOCA , and the Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA and PiTaPa of KANSAI THRU PASTHRU PASS can be used at all stations .
In the south of Joyo Station , the station is a simple ticket gate that is operated by Mujin Station .
In 1984 , the limited express ' Kuroshio ' operated between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station was abolished by the Nara Line , Sakurai Line , Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line , and until 1991 , only local trains were operated as local trains until 1991 , but nowadays there are four types of local trains that were operated between Miyakoji Station and Rapid trains , Rapid trains , Rapid and local trains .
It is the nearest type of the Nara Line , and is mainly operated during the daytime mainly during the daytime .
Basically , a local train connects with a local train at Uji Station with a local train and a local train at Uji Station .
The nickname of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was decided by the public before the operation started .
Many of the trains that connect Kyoto and Nara , which are tourist spots , use not only Japanese but also foreigners , but also for tourists .
All the trains are operated in the JR West Series 221 and are operated with four - car trains or six cars .
The maximum speed of the double - track section is 110 km / h and the maximum speed is operated at 110 km / h , and the speed is 95 km / h other than that is 95 km / h.
Approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara , and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Nara .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamitakoma Station or Tanakura Station in the middle of the station , and there are some differences between the inbound and outbound trains in the distance between Nara and Nara .
During the three days of the new year , Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station in order to visit Fushimi Inari Station .
History
March 3 , 2001 : The operation began operating .
March 15 , 2003 : Due to the revision of the timetable revision , the station began to stop at Tofukuji Station and Tamamizu Station .
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours .
It also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) .
All trains are operated in the Series 221 and are operated with four - car trains or six cars .
Basically , a local train connects with a local train at Uji Station with a local train and a local train at Uji Station .
In the same way as the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above , the Yamatoji Line rapid trains stop at Hirayama Station , which is operated by the Yamatoji Line .
The stops of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' were used until March 2001 when ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was introduced , and the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 was used in Kyoto , Uji and Kizu and Nara ; however , the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 was not used in the Nara Line .
In the morning and evening , there are trains that directly connect the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line .
It is mainly operated in the morning and night .
At first , only weekdays , it was operated on weekdays , but due to the timetable revision made on March 18 , 2006 , it came to be operated on Saturday and holidays .
Although trains stop at each station between Uji Station and Nara Station , there was a rapid train bound for Kizu in the vicinity of midnight due to the difference between the local trains bound for Uji Station and the local trains running in the vicinity of the station , but nowadays the local train running on the local rapid train was changed to a train that ran at the end of the section .
There are some trains that use JNR 103 series JNR 103 from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays , and all trains are operated on the 221 series 21 .
During the morning rush hour there is a train that runs directly from the Yamatoji Line because it is convenient .
As rapid trains on the Nara Line tried to avoid mistakes with rapid trains in the Yamatoji Line , the color of oranges was used as a line color , but due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 2008 , the type of rapid trains in the section was used as a green and the color was not used as a color .
In the postmark of the station on the north side of Kamikoma Station , it is described as a purple letter .
It runs between Kyoto Station and Uji , Joyo and Nara Station .
During the daytime the section between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station runs every 15 minutes , but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station is 30 minutes .
Basically , trains are operated in the 103 series cars , but some of them are operated in the 2221 series cars .
In the early morning and late evening , there are trains that directly connect the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late evening .
In the past , there was a direct train with the Sakurai Line , but on September 4 , 1994 , the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines : the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line .
Although it was a special train , limited express trains were sometimes operated on the Nara Line .
From 1987 to 1988 , the name ' Kuroshi ( train ) ' was changed from 1987 to 1989 by the nickname of ' Kuroshio ' and it was operated via the Kansai Main Line and the Hakuhama Line , the Kansai Main Line and the Hanwa Line via the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line .
In the Kinki Shinbun Newspaper published on January 6 , 1998 , there was an announcement that a limited express train would run on the Nara Line with 381 series of limited express trains on the Nara Line ( commuter train ) , but the plan was stopped after that .
Although it was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station as the Miyakoji Rard , there was a time when direct trains to the Sakurai Line were operated between Kyoto Station and Nara Station ( Miyakoji Rapid Service between Nara and Nara ) but no direct trains to the Sakurai Line are operated at present .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Fireworks held at the nearest station to Uji Station , but since the schedule schedule is usually limited to the final schedule , only local trains run between Kyoto and Uji only 10 minutes .
There are some local trains that arrive at and depart from Kizu Station .
The special schedule of the New Year 's Day at that time became completely different and the rapid trains stopped at each station between Kyoto and Uji Station , and the number of trains was increased to more than the Uji Station .
Depending on the year , there were some trains that came back to Momoyama Station .
In 1992 , direct trains bound for the Sakurai Line were extended to a rapid train on Saturdays and holidays mainly on Saturdays and holidays , and one hour was operated between Tenri Station and Tenri Station .
In addition , there are some trains that are exclusively operated by a group from all over the country .
Particularly , when the Tenri Religious Festival held every October 26 , the trains called ' special trains for the Tenri Line ' are operated between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station on the Nara Line and the Yamatoji Line between Nara Station and Nara Station and Sakurai Line .
All of them belonged to Nara Train Depot .

Keiji Bypass is a bypass of National Highway Route from Kusatsu City , Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama - cho , Kuse - gun , Kyoto Prefecture .
It is designated as a plan for regional high - standard roads
The following is the section on the Keiji Bypass of the Uryo Road and the Keiji Bypass of National Route 1 and National Route 24 .
It has been integrated with the Meishin Expressway and is connected with the Kuridashi Interchange of the Meishin Expressway , the Kyoto City City area and the direction of the city of Kyoto City , the Kuridashi Interchange and the Suita Interchange of Nagoya City and Osaka City .
By the law , the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama Yodo Interchange are designated as National Highway Route 1 and National Route 478 , and the Kumiyama Interchange ( Keiji Bypass ) , the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange and Oyamazaki Junction , National Highway Route No . 478 , the Kokudo Jidoshado Expressway , the Kokudo Jidoshado Expressway , and the National Highway Highway Route No . 2 , the Kyoto Prefectural Road No . 2 and the Yodo Interchange of the National Highway Highway Highway Route No . 28 .
As the plan was planned later , the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway was built in order to improve the delay of the Meishin Expressway and the construction of roads that had functions of Kyoto City and Kyoto City as well as the Kyoto Bypass with the Kyoto Tanba Road and the Keiji Bypass which was a bypass of National Highway Route 9 was a bypass of National Highway Route 9 .
The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway have been designated National Highway 478 and has been maintained consistently .
In the indication of the line , it is considered to be a Keiji Bypass in the Seta Higashi CTT - Oyamazaki JT , which is easy to understand the users of the route .
Also , the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass are different from the ETC system , although there are differences between the tolls and the ETC system .
When there is no special note , the Keiji Bypass ( from the Seta Higashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki JCT ) is described as the name of the business route .

August 29 , 1988 : The Seta Higashi Interchange and JCT - JC - JC - JT - CT / Ogura - Interchange were opened .
March 30 , 2003 : The Ogura - Interchange - Kumiyama JC - T - TS opened .
As a result , the tolling system was unified by the other Nippon Road Public Corporation ( now Netko ) and the other Nippon Road Public Corporation ( present Network Expressway ) .
August 10 , 2003 : The entire line between Kumiyama JCT and Oyamazaki JCT , which were opened to traffic .

The Uji Tunnel is the longest 4,313 meters in the National Route 1 , and the tunnels are prohibited except for 500 meters in front of the Uji - higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange .
In the vicinity of the Kumiyama Junction , the film was shot in the film " Dancing One " before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction .
When the distance between Seta Interchange and Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT , the Keiji Bypass is shorter than the Meishin Expressway , the Keiji Bypass is more shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and when it runs on the maximum speed of the maximum speed of the station , the Keiji Bypass runs earlier than the Keiji Bypass via the Keiji Bypass .
Since there are no resting facilities such as the service area , the Meishin Expressway is often crowded with the congestion of the Meishin Expressway , and the rest of the rest of the Meishin Expressway is the Otsu Service Area , and the Katsuragawa Park .
However , the structure of both the Seta and Oyamazaki Junction , which was established after the name of the god , is a very complicated structure ( especially the structure of the JCTTT of Oyamazaki JCT , which is a very complicated structure , has a complicated structure , is the same as that of the road in which the road is operated through the area where the road is operated by the OYAMAZAKI .
When you go from Oyamazaki JTT to Suita and Osaka from the Oyamazaki JT , there is an inconvenience that you can get along the Meishin Expressway and the left side of the Meishin Expressway .
In addition , since the curve and the sloping road have continued , it does not function as a bypass of the Meishin Expressway .
Since this road is a bypass of National Route 1 ( general national road ) , it is an exclusive road for motorcycles , and is not a highway for high - speed Expressway .
When you pass the Keiji Bypass from the east side of the Uji - gawa River , you must pass through the Uji Nishi Interchange when you pass the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is the Harff IC of the Uji - higashi Interchange .
For this reason , the general road section between the Uji Higashi Interchange and the Uji Nishi Interchange is often traffic during the time of commution .
Because this general road section is an unprovided , it is difficult to avoid traffic due to the fact that it is an unsuitable section for the VICS Squadron .

Amaterasu Omikami is a god ( human ) appearing in Japanese mythology .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , when it was enshrined as a god of nature , it is called ' Ameteru . '
It is one of the deities that deify the sun and are considered to be one of the deities of the Imperial family .
In the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it is written as 天照大神神 ( 天照大神 ) in the Kojiki ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , and in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) it is written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
He was also called Ohirume no Muchi no Kami .
In the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , several gods were described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , but in the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it was unified by the name of the god called ' Tensho Daijin ' in the name of the god .
Although she was a goddess , there is a theory that she was actually a male god .
Since the name of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as " Kotai Jingu Gishiki , " it is said that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and became the ancestor of the Imperial family .
In the Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amazume no Okami or Sumeramikami , or when the name of the god is enshrined before the festival , it is also referred to as Amateruimasu no kami or Amenosakasume - no - kami when the god is enshrined .
In academic documents today , the word ' Amaterasu ' and katakana are used as a custom .
There is also a theory that it was written as 天照太神 .
Description in mythology
According to the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , when Izanagi was living in Izanami , he came back from the land of Izanami , and when he washed the impurities of the dead , he was born when he washed his left eyes .
On this occasion , he was born from the right eye and was born from the nose , and he was called Mikoshi ( three noble children ) along with Susanoo who was born from the nose .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to govern Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susanoo who was entrusted to Kaibara continued to cry that he would go to Nenokuni where Izanami had lived , so he was expelled by Izanami .
Susanoo met his older sister , Amaterasu Omikami , before he went to Nenokuni ( the Nine Kingdom ) and went to Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , but Amaterasu Omikami thought that he would take Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) and waited for him .
In order to prove the purity of Susanoo , the three goddesses were born from the real power of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to the five gods from the real reality of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to Susanoo , and Susanoo declared victory .
He was born from the real power of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and was regarded as a child of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and the following five deities are the deities of the following five gods .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Hikutsuhikone
Kusunokuten
Susano who was frightened by this , worked hard in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amaterasu Omikami hid herself in Ama no Iwato ( heavenly rock cave ) .
In the middle of the world , there were various misfortunes in the world .
( The eight hundred million deities including Yagorogi no mikoto and Amenokoyane no mikoto succeeded in making Amaterasu Omikami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , and so on , and Susanoo was expelled from Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
He sent his son Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) .
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) was subdued and Amenohoshihomimi descended after Ninigi was born , Ninigi descended from his grandson Ninigi .
interpretation
In the mythology , there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be the god of the nation because he showed the action of Amatsukami ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) who was born earlier than himself or in the mythology , and because there is a scene in which Amaterasu Omikami was in accordance with the instructions of the god .
There is also a view that the shrine was deified as a god of ancient shrine maidens .
It is also called ' 日女女 ' ( 日女女 ) and refers to miko ( a shrine maiden ) who served the sun god .
The sun god was originally a male god , but there is a theory that the shrine maiden who served was identified with the sun god was identified with the sun god and became a goddess .
In addition , there is a theory that this goddess was established in the era of Empress Jito , who was a female emperor , and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
It is pointed out that the birth of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukuyomi ( Tsukuyomi or Tsukuyomi no kami ) was a strong influence of Taoism in the " Ryoho Gofu Jo " ( the Preface of the Five Sacred Treasuress ) ( before the sixth century ) , which was written in the " Ryoho Gofu " ( the first half of the sixth century ) , which was a Buddhist sutra of Taoism , and in the " Ryoho Gofu " ( the first half of the seventh century ) , it was written in the " Ryoho Gofu " ( the first half of the seventh century ) , and it is pointed out that it had a strong influence on the right eye of the right eye of Taoism .
It is also believed that the names of the Ise - jingu Shrine and Ise - jingu Shrine , such as the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Saigu , the Saigu , the Saikan , the Saikan , the Saikan , the Saikan , the Shigi no Mura no Miya , the Miginu ( purification ) , and Usukinou ( white silk fabrics ) are different from the names of the five colors of the gods , and the Taoist theory of the Ojingu Shrine and the Taoism .
According to comparative mythology , the birth mythology of Amaterasu Omikami was almost equal to that of the ancient mythological mythology which records the oldest period ( 3 to 4 centuries ) recorded in the ancient times .
Also , there is a theory that it is considered that both the sun and the moon spread to the Asian area , so that it is a myth that it was introduced to Japan along with ethnic groups in the earlier history .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the shrine was transformed into the third stage .
The following is a summary of the incident and the contents of the movement .
645 : Taika Reforms
Before that , the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
" Hijin no kami " ( 日神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) (
A male god called ' Ameru , ' was widely enshrined there .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines such as ' Akamasu - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima , ' Issunimasu Amateru ' in Harima , and ' Ameteru ' in Tanba .
In addition , the term " Otoko - kama " is also used as the name of Amenohoakari , a grandson of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and Amenowakahiko is also the founder of the Owari clan , the Tsunamori clan , and the Kaibe clan .
In addition , the younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi and the great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : The Jinshin War
Ohihirume no Muchi no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Muchime ' or ' Tanatatsutatsume '
In this case , the enshrined deity is interpreted as Ohirume no Sumeramikoto , who is a goddess , and there is an interpretation that it is the ' ameteru ' of a snake .
698 : Kotai - jingu Shrine was established .
Amaterasu ( the Sun Goddess ) and ' the ancestor of the Imperial family . '
She was a goddess .
Emperor Jito was modeled after the Emperor Jito , and it was created from a natural god to a humanity god .
Even after that , the term ' Tenteru ' other than Koto - shin was also referred to as ' Ama no teru . '
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( Tarashina Diary ) , it is written as ' 天照御神 ' ( 1060 ) , and the part of ' 天照神 ' is read as ' Ameru , ' and also ' Amatsukume ' in " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
1880 - 1881 , a fierce controversy occurred over the enshrined deities of the Shinto Jimukyoku Bureau in Hibiya , Tokyo .
The Shinto Jimukyoku insisted that the three deities were enshrined as the enshrined deities of the Bureau of Divinities ( Amenominakanushi no Kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Kamimusubi no kami ) , and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) should be enshrined in this world , but the Izumo school should be integrated into ' Yuikai ' ( the world ) .
However , the ' Ise school ' which was the center of Shinto Jimukyoku was the ' presidence ' that Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) ruled the two worlds of Kenyu and insisted that other deities were not subject to subject .
In the end , there were various views such as ' The Izumo school had a grudge that had continued since the age of the gods ' and ' the Imperial family should kill Senke Sonfuku , who had a bad mind in the Imperial family . '
Before long , the controversy was taken over by Emperor Meiji 's decision , and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was ranked as the highest rank .
It is said that the government recognized that it was impossible to control the people directly based on the theory of Fukushin Shinto .
Refer to the controversy of the enshrined deities of State Shinto Jimukyoku ( the Bureau of Shinto Shrines ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA introduced Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) in his own novel to his own novel , and he used another name ' Ohirume no Sumeru ' ( also known as Ohirume no Ki ) .
Since the term ' Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess)'Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was used as the name of the sun god or natural god , it was not necessary to use the word ' 大日日日日日比売神 ' because it was written as ' 大日日日比売神 . '
In fact , there are many novels written by AKUTAGAWA who were not able to revise the corrections of the army and copying the scandal of the army ; they were not able to do so .
In 1926 , Masaatsu YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) founded the Kinkei Gakuin School ( 1926 ) said , ' Japan has the belief of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is the ideal of the Japanese spirit , and this is to mean the world 's spirit .
The word ' Izana ' in Izanagi and Izanagi 's words is a ideal of the world 's predecessor , the pioneer of the world . '
Shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami
The shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami are called Kamimeijinja Shrines throughout the country and the main shrine is the inner shrine ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) of the Jingu Shrine ( Ise - jingu Shrine ) .
The Kotai - jingu Shrine is a Shinto shrine that enshrines Yata no kagami , one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family .
In most shrines throughout Japan , the shinsatsu of Kotai - jingu Shrine ( Ame no Kotai - jingu Shrine ) is distributed in most shrines throughout Japan .

Daimyo in the Edo period
The daimyo in the Edo period were determined by the social standing of social standing and official ranks , the official rank of kokudaka ( crop yield ) and the post of the post and the shikoseki ( consultant ) in the Edo period .
Firstly , due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family , it was classified as a tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) who was a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara , mainly fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who was a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara .
When the Shogun family became extinct , the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which were allowed to use the Tokugawa family as well as the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , were established in order to keep the bloodline of the shogun family and to supervise the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was allowed to use the Tokugawa family name of the Tokugawa family as well as the Shogun family , and the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA of the Owari Domain and the 10th son Yorinobu TOKUGAWA were appointed to the Mito Domain .
In addition , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to the Echizen Domain as well as daimyo ( feudal lord ) of the Tokugawa clan throughout the country .
In addition , the fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who had established the foundation of the Tokugawa Shogun family were placed as Fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and also held important posts centered on roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) at the beginning of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
Although the Ii clan , the head of fudai daimyo ( fudai daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) of the Ii clan , had a large amount of koku ( crop yield ) of 35 thousand koku , the Torii clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , and the Ogasawara clan , which had been more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period , the Sakai clan , the Abe clan , the Horii clan , the Yanagizawa clan , and so on were given a relatively large amount of territories and only a few fudai daimyo ( fudai daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who maintained more than 100,000 koku ( crop yield ) during the Edo period .
This came to be used for separation of power and military power .
After the Battle of Sekigahara , tozama daimyo were daimyo who were subordinate to the Tokugawa family and many families fought against the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara .
However , he was strongly concerned about the shogunate and actively actively actively worked as intelligent activities , and he was punished by being punished by being punished by being deprived of his fief when he was afraid of his misfortunes or a scheme .

In addition , the status of daimyo was divided according to the social status of daimyo ( daimyo ) who had more than one koku or more than one koku or more than one koku of kokudaka ( crop yield ) which was equivalent to that of kokushu ( lord of a castle ) , and those with a castle were called joshukaku ( lord of a castle ) ( joshukaku ( lord of a castle ) or jinya ( regional government office ) , and daimyo were not allowed to participate in the Edo Castle .
For more information , refer to the article on the shikoseki ( seats for vassals of the Tokugawa shogunate ) .
Daimyo were not allowed to have the status of daimyo ( feudal lord ) , but the daimyo with 100,000 koku was not allowed to have the whole territory of the land , and most of them had territories in the vicinity of the castle town .
In the extreme case , one village was divided into other feudal lords and governed one village ( shokyu [ salary ] ) .
Although daimyo were more than 10,000 koku in principle , the Kiregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was 5000 koku .
This was because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan .
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the Buke Shohatto ( laws for samurai families ) and the Sankinkotai system ( a system in which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In addition , in the end of the Edo period , daimyo were appointed to the officer who was called Ote - denyaku ( job of guarding the coast of the sea ) or the defense of the seashore because they were ordered to defend the coast , and the daimyo always suffered financial difficulties .
The word " daimyo " is used to refer to daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) .
