Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a facility for preservation of steam locomotives operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Kankiji-cho, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, Japan National Railway's 100th anniversary of the establishment of Japan Railway Company (JR West) was established in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, and steam locomotives that had been supported by Japan Railway Company (JR West) were regarded as valuable cultural properties and the first facility for the purpose of preservation.
In 1987, JR West took over the division and privatization of JNR.
This facility is the current vehicle (Umekoji Operation) of the company, and is also conducted as an inspection and repairing of the JNR D1010 locomotive owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway and the Japan National Railways owned by Sagano Scenic Railway.
In the first place, this facility started to be established and it was because the steam locomotive disappeared rapidly from the latter half of the 1960's.
At first, the Oyama-ku district located in Oyama, Tochigi Prefecture was the most candidate for preservation and the site was located at the site of the 'central part of Japan' but it was officially selected as a preservation institution in 1970 because it was located near the capital's capital area, because it was located near the Tokyo Metropolitan Area.
In principle, the cars for preservation were examined to select the existing cars (if it is possible to be the first one can be used, but there are some cars that were not preserved at first, such as the C22-2, C22.
The facilities are composed of "Steam Locomotive Exhibition Hall," which utilizes the former Umekoji Organ Steam Locomotive Plain, and "Historical Materials Exhibition" which was reconstructed and reconstructed by the former Nijo residence of the former Nijo family.
The Ogata Kuri was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914 and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the five tentative ceiling, the ceiling, the ceiling, and the Hikomi Line were designated as national important cultural properties.
In the same year, in 2004, he was selected as the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Presents.
In 2006, the former Nijo Station building (exhibition) and the Ogi-shako depot and the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of a railroad were designated as a national treasure.
The former Nijo station building was built in 1904 with the oldest wooden building in Japan where the Kyoto Railway Company (JR West) was constructed as the main shrine, and it was designed to imitate Heian-jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape.
The Kyoto Railway was nationally nationalized in 1907, and after that, it was used as a station building for JR West, but in 1996, it was replaced by the construction of the Sanin Main Line between Nijo Station and Hanazono Station of the Sanin Main Line (Sagano Line), and the station building was reconstructed as a station building, and the interior of the station building was reconstructed, and the interior of the station was used as a relay site of the station building.
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996.
In Ogata Kuri (Ogata House), 16 domestic steam locomotives, which were produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period, are installed and exhibited on display and exhibited.
At the beginning of the opening, the motivation was basically preserved and there were 15 cars of C53 cars and C51 cars of C51 and 2399 cars of C51 were registered in the Ministry of Education, but it has been decided that the storage machine has been preserved for seven cars in 2006.
The five cars are still registered in the five cars, and the two cars (C557 and C555516) are used in the Yamaguchi Line and the 'Yamaguchi-(train)' and the Hokuriku Main Line, and the 'Kitabi-ko (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line are used for the trains that are operated on the Tokaido Main Line.
Although there are no taxis for the preservation machines other than these two cars, it cannot be carried out on the main line because there are no inspection in all directions.
In addition, the 'SL Squom' is operated by the track of the railway in the vicinity of the museum.
This exhibition line was once located north of the depot and was used to be a large-size parking park, but it was changed to the north of the site where the current large-size vehicle was located in the north of the former Nijo Station (where a rest facility and a park), and the current Umekoji Park was located in the vicinity of the former Nijo Station and the south end of the current Umekoji Park was changed to the Sagano Line.
Even now, it has a function as a institute and is also connected to the business line.
Furthermore, after the Takadori factory of West Japan Railway Company (JR West) was closed, steam locomotives were also developed.
Baime
It comes from 'Ume' which means Umekoji Station.
All cars that were designated as the C62 cars in 1976 were designated as a quasi-railway monument, along with the list of the cars of the C62 cars and the conservative tools.
In 1972, there are no special items that have been handed down from the former institute district of 1972 to the procedures of transmission from the previous organization.

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music.
It is a religious music used for rituals and ceremonies.
In Japan, it is also called Bonbai or Bonbon-zori.
In the old style, the Chinese characters were written as "myo."
It is one of the studies of ancient India.
Gogyo refers to five kinds of vocational schools, such as Shomyo (learning of phonology and gramm), Kyoryo (technology), Kyoryo (study of techniques and technology), Iho (medical science), Inmei (ethics (ethics of one's own sect), Naimei (learning of Buddhism) and Buddhist monks.
Along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, it has been handed down to Japan.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in 754 when the Great Buddha Hall was held in Todai-ji Temple, and it is believed that Shomyo was popular in the Nara period.
In the beginning of the Heian period, Saicho and Kukai passed the voice and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo.
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect also have their own voices and are still inherited today.
Because the voice was handed down in kuden (oral tradition), there was no gakufu (musical instrument).
As a result, the denju became difficult for this purpose.
Later, hakase, who was a gakufu (musical instrument), was invented.
There are differences in terms of specialized terms such as hakase depending on each school.
However, Hakase is a reference to recite the voice and if it is necessary to learn Shomyo (Shomyo in Japanese), it is necessary to keep the school from a master to his disciple.
For this reason, the training of the leaders and successors was required.
Many schools were abolished due to various conditions.
The Tendai Shomyo sect was introduced by Saicho and developed its own style.
After Saicho, Ennin and Anzen became prosperous.
Ryonin who was the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu is known as the restorer of the family.
In 1109, Ryoin built Raigo-in Temple in Ohara in Kyoto (Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City).
The honorific mountain prefix of Raigo-in Temple in Ohara was changed to Gyosan, the birthplace of the Chinese Shomyo in China, and was called Uozan.
Before long, two temples of Raigo-in Temple and Shorin-in Temple came to be known as the dojo for Shomyo of the Ohara school.
In addition, Jakuren later established a school and in Ohara there was a voice of two groups.
Later, Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo.
It was based on a new theory of music that Tanchi built a flow based on new music.
Since then, the center of the Tendai Shomyo sect has been passed down to the present Tendai Shomyo.
The Yuzu Nenbutsu, Jodoshu sect, Jodo Shinshu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect Shomyo line of the Tendai Shomyo sect are descended from the Tendai Shomyo sect.
Shingon-Shomyo is the basis of the transmission of Kukai and has been handed down to this day.
It has been after the Shinga period when Shomyo has been systematized.
Kancho can be said to be the restorer of the family.
He worked as a composer of Shomyo (Shomyo).
There were many schools until the Kamakura period, but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho, by four schools (Honsoin school, Shingonin, Daigo and Nakagawa Daishin).
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period.
The Honsoin school and the Shinkoin-ryu and Daigo schools were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period.
At present, it is divided into Chizan, Chishaku-in Temple, Buzan (Nara/Hase-dera Temple) and Nanzan Shinryu (Nanzan-ryu, Koyasan, and Kogi Shingon sect).
The Ryomei school originated from the Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo of the Shingi Shingon sect (Shingi Shingon sect Shomyo), the Chizan school of the Shingon sect and the Buzan school of the Shingon sect and the Fuyo school originated from the Nakagawa Daishin school.
Raiyu adopted the old school of Daigo.
When Negoro-ji Temple (Wakayama Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583, both Chizan and Toyosan, formed a new school based on the old school of Daigo and became a part of the school.
The characteristic is that it is called 'ronron' (論論論) of Mt. Toyama, 'ron' (論論論) and 'shomyo' (明明) of Mt. Chizan (Mt. Chizan.
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school of the Nanzan Shingon-shu sect (Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect) was the origin of the Nakagawa school.
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa Temple in Nara Prefecture.
In 1232 to 1233, he moved his base to Rengeidani and Sanbo-in Temple to Mt. Koya.
It was later called the Nanzan Shinryu (Nanzan school) after the name of Mt. Koya.
It is also called Shinryu or Noyama Shinryu.
It can be said that the sounds such as Heikyoku (Noh song), Yokyoku (Noh song), Minyo (Noh song), and Joruri (dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment) were changed to the change of voice.
It greatly influenced the simple melody.
Emperor Tenchi (also known as Emperor Tenchi) was Emperor Tenchi.
He was a man.

He was the thirty-eighth Emperor.
His shigo (posthumous name) was Ame no Mikoto, Ame no Sumeramikawake no Mikoto, and also called Ameminomikoto.
His posthumous name was Kazuraki or Katsuragi.
It is believed that he was called Katsuragi no Miko or Katsuragi no Miko.
It is generally known as Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji or Naka no Oe no Oe.

On February 20, 668, he succeeded to the throne.
January 7, 672 - He died at the age of 46.
("Fuso Ryakki" (A Brief History of Japan) says that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated in the mountains because he died of illness after the death of a disease, saying 'If the Emperor was in the palanquin of the palanquin and the mountain was not able to go back to Mt. Nagatsuyama and the mountain where there is no reason to be a place where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was dead.'
It is one of the mysteries of politics in the middle of the seventh century, when Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time and was not enthroned.
There are several theories about this theory.
This is the consideration for the power of the Emperor Tenmu.
In other words, Emperor Tenmu, who was believed to have been a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, is wrong, and it is said that Emperor Tenmu was the Emperor Han, who was born before the Empress Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei, and he was an older brother of Emperor Tenchi.
It is certain that the year of Emperor Tenmu was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenchi in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and some history books of the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) at the age of the Emperor Tenmu, and Emperor Tenmu became the longer.
However, there are no contradictory contradictions, and there are many historical materials that contain the difference between the age of 8 and 99 in the same historical materials.
On the other hand, according to the fact that his father was not different, his younger brother was wrong, he was intentionally saying "Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)" that the age of Tenchi was the age of 16 when his father Emperor Jomei ascended the throne.
Therefore, the year of his birth is 614, which is the year of his birth was adopted by Honcho Koin Shoenroku (record of the Emperor's family members) and so on, and it is said that he was born in 614.
In a counterargument with the "Ancient period," the Emperor had the right to ascend the throne and the emperor who had not been rare in ancient times (actual in fact, Tenchi and Michiko who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu) was also called Shosei and did not ascend the throne.
It is said that there were errors for this purpose.
There is also a theory that it is pointed out that other history books which have been pointed out as 'Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)' are different from the fact that it was compiled in the same period as the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) are not treated as the same.
(Refer to the article on the age of Emperor Tenmu.)
It is said that the Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat of Prince Karu (Emperor Kotoku), and Naka no Oe was driven from the position.
In recent years, the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good and it has been pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of the policy.
If Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji (Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji (Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji [Prince Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji
In addition, this theory has been advocated since the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) were revised and the Taika Reforms of Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) were identified and the theory came to be accepted.
In this theory, the reason for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka were not expelled after the coup d'etat was not expelled after the coup d'etat and other doubts are notical.
There is a theory that the enthronement was delayed due to the opposition from the relationship between the women of the Emperor Tenji.
It is said that Emperor Kotoku, who was described in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), showed the relationship between her and Tenchi in the poem that she was a wife of the Emperor and a daughter of the same mother of the Emperor Tenchi.
Although the love and marriage between her half brother and sisters were allowed to be allowed to be forgiven, she was actually in love with the older brother of the same mother, but it is interpreted that she was actually involved in the relationship between her uncle, Michiko TONAKA and her younger brother, and even after she got married to her uncle, Prince Karu (Emperor Kotoku).
After the death of Empress Saimei, the Imperial Princess Hashihito succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous Emperor, but there is a theory that the records were lost due to some circumstances.
It is said that this is because it comes from the theory that 'Naka no Mikoto' was a princess who was called 'Naka no Mikoto' in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), and it can be interpreted that 'Naka no Mikoto was the Emperor who was the heir to the throne until the enthronement of Emperor Tenji.
If Hashihito no Himemiko = 'Naka no Mikoto,' the reason why she was called 'Nakanomikoto' can be said to be a special reason why she had to be called by the name of this name, but there is a theory that it is not certain.
Although it is difficult to prove the nature of the political history and historical materials, it is difficult to prove it, and the study of research has been progressed, including the cooperation of archaeologists and so on.
Poems
He was also a poet of Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) that had four poems of Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by the Heian period, the following poem is included in the beginning of the poem.
The autumn rice field is covered with the horns of the rice field and the rest of the robes are rare.
The following poems are also included in Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).

The Saionji family was a court noble who belonged to the Fujiwara clan.
He was from the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and his family status was Seiga (the second highest family status for court nobles).
The Toin family and the Imadegawa family were divided into the Saionji family.
In addition, the Saionji clan in Iyo Province was a powerful branch of the Saionji clan, who used the family name of Saionji.
The family crest is made of the left trips.
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane.
Since Michisue's great-grandchild Kintsune SAIONJI had a niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo as his wife, he was caught by the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and after the Jokyu War, he gained the power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi (liaison between the bakufu and the Kanto region) and gained the social status of Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).
The name of the Saionji family comes from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his villa in Kyoto (Kitayama-mura, Kadono County, Yamashiro Province).
This hall was also called Kitayama-dono, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA by the Saionji family.
After Kintsune, he was supported by the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and the power of the Sekke (line of regents and advisers) continued throughout the Kamakura period.
Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama), and he put his daughter to the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo.
However, after his son, Kinhira SAIONJI, the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) came to have a distance from the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and he supported the Jimyoin line and deepened the confrontation with Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama).
After that, when Kinmune SAIONJI died, the Kamakura bakufu fell, and he was dismissed from the position of Kanto moshitsugi.
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO, who was the remnant of the Hojo clan, and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration, and planned to install the Retired Emperor Go-Fushimi, and Kinmune was arrested due to the betrayal of his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI who was a younger brother of the Jimyoin line.
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, Sanetoshi SAIONJI, a son of Kinmune and served the Northern Court (Japan) and became Udaijin (minister of the right) and restored the family name.
In the Muromachi and Edo periods, he was also known as a family who was the family business of biwa (Japanese lute).
In the early Edo period, Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime, the eldest daughter of Tadataka HOSOKAWA (later disinherited later)), who was the legitimate son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA (later became disinherited) and was appointed to Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) but Kyumu NAGAOKA donated 600 koku (crop yields) to the Saionji family and donated 600 koku (crop yields).
In the end of the Edo period, Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted by the Tokudaiji family of the Kanin school, and after the Meiji Restoration, he was active as a politician, and he became a Genro (elder statesman) in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods.
Although Kinmochi, who was the family business of the Saionji family, was a hard-liner, he was said to be a bad play by the Emperor Meiji in half of his bad games, and he was said to be 'a biwa player of the Saionji family,' and he played a role in gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music) and biwa biwa (Japanese lute) in the Imperial Household Ministry.

After Enryaku-ji Temple was opened to Hiedama, Oyamakui no kami was regarded as the guardian deity of the Tendai sect and Enryaku-ji Temple as the guardian deity of the landlord, and the mountain belief spread to Oyamakui no kami (the god of the mountain where the god resided).
In addition, the temple is also a mountain of worship, and is also a mountain where a thousand days walk from the temple on the top of Mt. Hiei and Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine at the foot of the mountain.
The climbing of the mountain is popular and there are some major climbs, such as Unomozaka Slope, which climb from Shugakuin in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, and Mudojidani (mountain path) on the Shiga Prefectural side of Shiga Prefecture, and the road that climb the mountain from Sakamoto-cho, Sakamoto-cho (Otsu City).

The reason why the book was given by the Imperial Court was given from the third volume was that 'Noin no Hazamurai' was a complete edition of Noinobon manuscript and Noinobon manuscript was published in the 'Sakai-bon manuscript' and the Maeda manuscript in the 'Sakai-bon manuscript.'
It is commonly accepted that the name of "Makura no soshi" comes from this.

Theory: Share: 'Shiki-ki (history book)' is written as 'Shiki-ta-makura (pillow to Shiki-dan-to)' in the form of a verb called 'Shiki-makura' (makurakotoba in which the word 'shiki-kanpu' is written in Chinese characters as 'shiki-ki' or 'shiki-dai' in Chinese characters).
History of writer: Many chapters of Utamakura, Shintoku, and Raju are used as a reference to the term

In addition, because Noin bon was used as the original edition of the old printing block in the early Edo period (Kanei era), it became a set of commentaries such as "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book) and "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book) and "Haru no soshi" (the Pillow of the Pillow Book) in the early Edo period, it was used as the mainstream of the book until the modern period.
However, in 1946, the third volume was reevaluated by Jutaro TANAKA (1917-1987) and the second volume was reevaluated, and after World War II, it became a situation where the book was mainly published.
In addition, it seems to have been used in the text of the kotobagaki (verb book), and there are seven sections in the picture scrolls of the Pillow Book, which were written in the late Kamakura period, as well as the "Ekotoba" (picture scrolls of the Pillow Book), which are thought to have been created in the late Kamakura period.
The third volume has more than 300 independent chapters.
The following are 'Suzumo' (chapter of a paragraph of a paragraph of a paragraph in the Heian period) and 'usuki-mono' (flower) typically represented by 'Suisakimono,' 'Ruiju-no-dan' (Commentaries on the Ruiju), and 'Zuishin-no-dan' (Commentaries on the Life) where daily life and natural observation of the seasons were observed, 'Zuishin-no-dan' (Commentaries on the Excerpts of the Life) and 'Teishi no Sho' (Commentaries of the Imperial Court and so on.
However, there are some differences in classification, such as 'Haru Akebone' (the first section of the chapter 'Haru no Akebone' (the first section for example, 'Haru no Akebone') (though it is commonly commonly accepted in the popular opinion).
It is written in a simple style of Japanese language that uses hiragana (hiragana, Japanese syllabaries), but it is written in general that it is a simple style of simple writing and a simple style of writing and a simple style of writing, but reflects the decline of the chancellor and the decline of the empress of his lord, Sadako, and there is a sense of emotional feeling that he had a sense of feeling of injury.
As a sensal and sharp observation of things were blended by the composer and the emotional expression of "The Tale of Genji," the beauty of the novel 'Amazure' was expressed as 'Amazare' in contrast to 'Genji Monogatari.'
Vocational evaluations
The "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow of the Pillow Book) was deeply loved by human existence, and it was formed as a beauty of various kinds of species in each color.
In the chapter of each chapter of each chapter from the next episode, the rich materials are not distinguished from those of the universe and the universe of the body, and the expression of the sky is often used in a vertical style by the expression of self-expression, which is different from those of the universe and the universe of the sky.
The expression of 'season' is a new term used in the "Kokinshu (Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry)," which is seen in Kokinshu (the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), while following a telephone of the 'spring/flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, and morning mornings and chor,' while people who were familiar with traditional Japanese traditional Japanese traditional Japanese traditions and were familiar with the sense of consciousness of beauty, and they were slashed by the new emperor (Toshimoto SHINDO).
It appeared in the love of Chugu Teishi, the Empress Teishi.
It was written in order to calm the soul of Sadako who died during the midst of misfortunes that Michitaka had declined.
Therefore, the decline of the Michitaka family was not described, and it is natural to be written in the same way as the above.
In the chapter of his own talent, even when the emperor took Chugu (the second consort of an emperor) and chugu (the second consort of an emperor), he claimed that he lived in the world of love with the Emperor because he was a favorite of the Emperor, and he insisted that he was in love with the Emperor (Ueno Ri [Kozuke Province]).
criticism
Even after he forgot from Sei Shonagon, he became a shock, and he appeared in the light of the light that he tried to become a member of the same class (Akizane).
(There is no respect to those who were not a relative of their relatives but a high social status as high as their relatives.)
It was not written by the qualification of the 'Bunmei no Bunmei' (records of civilization) of Teishi kokyu (empress's residence), but it was not written by the qualification of 'individual' (Junji ISHIDA).
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and he was the fifteenth Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867.
He was the only shogun who did not attend the duties of the shogun in the Edo-jo Castle.
He was Naidaijin (minister of the center) Juichii (Junior First Rank) and the First Order of the Rising Sun.
He was a member of the House of Peers (Japan).
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, who served as the guardian of the Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
After Emperor Meiji returned to the Meiji government (= Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the emperor]), he tried to reconcile with the Imperial Court but in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he returned from Osaka-jo Castle to the Edo Castle while he left the former Shogunate army after the Restoration of Imperial Rule and returned to the Edo-jo Castle, and he was ordered to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court, and was forced to surrender.
When he was suspended from house arrest in the Meiji period, he died in his hobbies and lived until the Taisho period.
Yoshinobu' is also read as 'Yoshinobu' or 'Keiki' as a common name.
There is a record that the official documents of the Edo bakufu were read as "Yoshihisa" in the official documents of the Edo bakufu.
The name of the word 'Yosaa' is also written in the alphabet and the English newspaper 'Yohoshi.'
In Mito City, where he was born, he is often called 'Yoshinobu' (Yoshinobu) but in Shizuoka City, where he lived there is often called 'Keiki' in his hometown.
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu in his lifetime, Yoshinobu seemed to be fond of 'Keiki-sama,' and he called himself 'Keiki' in the telephone that he was a younger brother of Akitake TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA, who was the successor of Yoshinobu, was also called 'Keyu sama' by people around him.
The two names of 'Keisan' and 'Keisan,' which are considered to be common in modern times, are often found in various places, but in either case, the term 'Keisan' can be found not only in Shizuoka but also in various places, it is often used to confirm the name of 'Keisan.'
Ryotaro SHIBA, who was called "Keiki" (literally, "Keiki" in Japanese) is said to have often been a retainer of the former shogunate, but it can be said that he was deeply respected by the people of Higo Domain who had been involved in the overthrow of the Shogunate, because it can be seen in the fact that even those who were involved in the overthrow of the Shogunate.
On October 29, 1837, he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa, Edo.
His mother was a lawful wife of Princess Yoshiko (the third shogun, Iemitsu TOKUGAWA), who was the legal wife of his lawful wife, and became the third shogun after Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.
However, the real mother of Iemitsu is said to be Oe no kata, who was the lawful wife of his father, Hidetada, but there is a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother.
His childhood name was Shichiromaro.
In accordance with the educational policy of Nariaki, he moved to the Mito Domain for seven months after his birth, and he was taught academics and martial arts by Shosai ISAWA, who had inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family.
It seems that Yoshinobu had attracted attention from that time and Nariaki was initially adopted by other families and he thought that he did not have any adopted son to other families, and he thought that he had to remain in his hands as a hika (waiting for his eldest son and legitimate son) of Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA.
On August 1, 1847, the bakufu ordered Shichiromaro from the Mito Domain to become the heir of the Hitotsubashi family of Gosankyo (the three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).
In response to this, Shichiromaro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1, and in December he was given the name of Yoshinobu by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence and thought that Yoshinobu was a powerful candidate for the successor of the shogun, but he gave up the position of roju Masahiro ABE, who was a member of shogun's council of elders.
In 1853, during the chaos of the arrival of the Black Ships, Shogun Ieyoshi died of illness and the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA did not have a son in poor health and had a problem that 'the heir would be the heir of the shogun.'
The Nanki school which supported Yoshinobu was opposed to Nariaki and Masahiro ABE, the lord of the Satsuma Domain, Nariakira SHIMAZU, and the lord of the Kishu Domain, Naosuke II, the lord of Hikone Domain and the real mother of Iesada's mother, Honjuin.
Although the Hitotsubashi school tried to support Tenshoin as the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU, the Shogun and the Midaidokoro of O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants resided) of the Shogun Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another, Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU lost their power and became Tairo (chief minister) in 1858, Naosuke II, who became the Tairo (chief minister) of the Tokugawa family decided to take over the decision.
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and America without Imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu went to Fujiki-jo Castle with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA, the lord of the Fukui Domain, but on the other hand, he was accused of the crime of Fuitori-jo Castle, and he was confined to retirement in 1859 (the Ansei no Taigoku).
In addition, Yoshinobu did not want to become the heir of the shogun, but he sent a letter to Nariaki saying 'It is not a translation.'
In 1860, he was confined to the house arrest.
In 1862, the Imperial envoy Shigenori OHARA was guarded by the Satsuma army led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, and the Emperor Komei issued an imperial order to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as a guardian of the shogun, Shungaku MATSUDAIRA (Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA) to become Tairo (chief minister).
On July 6, the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu to the position of Shogun and Shungaku to the position of Seiji sosai.
Yoshinobu and Shungaku did not carry out the reform of the shogunate called Bunkyu Reforms, and established the Kyoto Shugoshoku (Military governor of Kyoto) and relied on Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In 1863, he went to Kyoto as the pioneer of the Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court who was in charge of the expulsion of foreigners.
When the Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners, Iemochi was unable to decide the expulsion of foreigners and ordered Iemochi to have an audience with Iemochi, who was called 'fictitious illness.'
When the Sonno Joi ha (supporters of the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners) led by the Choshu clan was expelled due to the Coup of August 18 (old lunar calendar), he went back to Kyoto again to participate in the council of councilors by the Kobu-gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate) and the Sabaku-ha (supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate).
However, it can be said that the meeting was not accepted, and it can be said that he was drunk in the sake seats of the Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko and defeated Munenari DATE, Shungaku MATSUDAIRA, and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, who were staying there, and he also said that he could not have been able to do so as to do so as to break down the situation.
After that, he was appointed to the governor of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto, Katamori MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Aizu Domain), the lord of the Aizu Domain, and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Kuwana Domain), who served as Shugoshiki (military governor) and Shugoshiki (military governor) of the Imperial Court, and he was in charge of controlling the royalists and court nobles (Ichikai-bashi Bridge and Kuwana Domain).
In the Tenguto War, Kounsai TAKEDA, who supported Yoshinobu, showed his coolness to his parents' home and vassals of the Mito Domain such as Kounsai TAKEDA.
In 1864, he commanded the bakufu army in the Kinmon Incident, and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence.
After the first conquest of Choshu, he worked hard for the Imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce which had been without imperial sanction and succeeded in obtaining the Imperial sanction of the United States and the United States.
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu received an imperial order of conquest of Choshu.
However, the army of the bakufu refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma Domain which had formed the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance, but the bakufu was defeated.
On July 20, during the second conquest of Choshu, Shogun Ieshige died in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu took part in the Imperial Court and succeeded in the conclusion of the Agreement of the war.
Although he was recommended as the successor of Iemochi, Yoshinobu firmly refused to do so.
On August 20, the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of shogun, but the position of Shogun continued to be rejected.
After that, roju and other members were asked to assume the position of shogun, but they did not accept it, and on December 5, he was appointed as Shogun by the Emperor of the Imperial Court.
In other words, he was a shogun who sold his favor and tried to move politics to compete with politics.
Yoshinobu was supported by the French minister, Léon LES, and he established the iron office of 240 million dollars from France and the construction of the Yokosuka River and Shubunsho (a military adviser), and invited the military advisers such as Julian and Franz to reform the military.
In addition, he also encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Paris World Exposition as a shogun's retainer, who was sent to the Paris World Exposition and also sent his younger brother Akitomo TOKUGAWA to Paris World Exposition Exhibition.
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port, the Imperial Court was permitted.
Yoshinobu, who was predicted by the Satsuma and Choshu, decided to return to the Imperial Court on October 14, 1867 (the previous hand was struck by his opponent) and received an imperial sanction (Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor) on November 15 (old lunar calendar).
It is said that the Imperial Court judged that there was no administrative capability, and tried to find the existence of the Tokugawa government in the form of the council of feudal lords.
However, due to the plot of Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA, the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December and Yoshinobu was ordered to 'Jikan nochi (transfer of the post of Naidaijin and the dedication of the Tokugawa shogunate).'
Yoshinobu left the Osaka-jo Castle to avoid conflicts, and he advocated the legitimacy of the Tokugawa clan by gathering ministers from foreign countries, and also made the Imperial Court moves the movement to revise his resignation, and he was able to make a gentle situation.
However, the following year, 1868, the Satsuma clan raised an army in the city of Edo, and the soldiers of Aizu, Kuwana Domain used the Aizu and Kuwana Domains.
However, in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi which broke out on January 3, when the former Shogunate army was disadvantageous and even though it was still enough to maintain its military force, he left the army and retreated to Edo in the military epic "Kaiyo Maru" (The Battle of Toba-Fushimi).
Soon after that, the order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu's enemy, and the government army led by the Minister of the Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started the expedition to the east.
Yoshinobu insisted that the resistance faction that Tadaosa KOKURI first had been the resistant faction, and insisted on allegiance to him.
In February, Kaishu KATSU was appointed to the position of Kaishu KATSU, and he himself was confined in Daiji-in Temple in Ueno City.
In addition, he was adopted by his adopted son, Yasunosuke TAIMA (later Iesato TOKUGAWA) and handed over to the head of the Tokugawa family.
When the negotiation between Katsu and the staff officer of the government and Takamori SAIGO became blood, Yoshinobu was transferred to Mito and continued to stay in the residence of the domain of the domain of the Kodokan school.
In July, the Tokugawa family moved to Sunpu where the Tokugawa family was transferred to Sunpu.

He was born in the highest environmental environment, and he was enthusiastic about swordplay from various martial arts.
Even after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), he is counted as one of the most famous swordsmiths of the swordplay that do not hold the training of the back of the swordplay until the time of his death.
When his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA was in a bed of the Tokugawa family as a problem, his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA had a shave in a pillow (just a threat that was just a threat, and it is said that he had a shaving sword in his sleep, and when he was sleeping, he saw the time of sleeping and sleeping.
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he was in a sleep, he was in the same position as two of his wife and two mistresses in the name of 'Y' (y) and two other mistress.
Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph in his childhood, but it is doubtful that the photograph of Yoshinobu was not seen in Japan.
It is said that he visited Iemochi, who fell ill and fell ill and he was usually talked about him.
He was known for his brilliant life, and he was praised by his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA and Tatewaki YASUSHIMA as a 'purifying Tokugawa line' and when Yoshinobu said that Yoshinobu was a 'purified man of the Tokugawa family' and he took the position of Shogun with a sound of recovery of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), he was praised as 'Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.'
Yoshinobu was also aware of the anti-shogunate faction, and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan especially said that 'Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI is not an inaccurate tactic of Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI.'
He was cautious about Ieyasu that he would come back again.
When Ryoma SAKAMOTO decided to return to the Imperial Court, Ryoma SAKAMOTO, 'Daini (Shogun)' and the present mind of the present day will be considered to be the same.
It is often said that they are given to them and they are often required to be given to him.
He gave the reputation to him and said, 'I will abandon my life,' and Yoshinobu tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser to the new government in order to give him the position of vice adviser to the Emperor.
However, Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was a person who knew that Ryoma was the person of the time, and after the death of Ryoma, he was in the Meiji period.
There was no story about Yoshinobu and Ryoma was very familiar with the fact that Ryoma was still alive, and the name of Ryoma was very lower than that of the Meiji Restoration.
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and he escaped to Edo, and was greatly criticized by his enemy.
At that time, Ieyasu forgot the horse seals of gold fans from Ieyasu but he did not forget his favorite concubine, and he was ridiculed by Yoshinobu's weakness.
However, there is a theory that Yoshinobu needed to oppose armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces, and because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the Imperial Court, he was forced to avoid the intervention of foreign countries, even if he was in a long time, even though he had to protect Osaka-jo Castle in order to avoid interference from other countries.
Since it is considered that the new government was considered to be an enemy of the Imperial Court, it is highly evaluated that the Emperor and the Imperial Court were placed in confinement at Kanei-ji Temple (Mitogaku (Mitogaku [Mitogaku [Mitogaku [Mitogaku [Mitogaku thought of reverence for the Emperor]) and his mother were strongly influenced by the Imperial Court, but on the other hand, it is said that he did not have been able to deal with the enemy as his lord.
Due to the fact that it was close to the Muikei Revolution, it was considered that the modern independence of Japan was protected by the modern Japanese independence and contributed to the restoration of the Meiji Restoration.
Eichi SHIBUSAWA, a businessman, was a vassal who was appointed to the family head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, and after the Meiji Restoration, he had a close relationship with the Meiji Restoration.
In his later years, Shibusawa tried to compile the biography of Yoshinobu and persuaded Yoshinobu who was astonished and asked him to listen to Naoyoshi's talent.
This is the "Shakumu Yumeki" (record of Yumeji in the past).
According to the chapter of a part of the Dankai, it is written in some cases, and it can be said that it is a slight voice of Yoshinobu, who is an old man.
It can be guessed that he was a man who did not like Hisamitsu SHIMAZU and said, "Hisamitsu SHIMAZU was not fond of Hisamitsu, and Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was a man of the time.
Based on the historical materials, the book was completed after Yoshinobu died, and it was "Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA" (Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA).
In order to show gratitude for the Emperor Meiji, who was the highest rank of the kazoku (peerage) and was given to the Emperor Meiji, who was given the title of the Emperor's enemy.
As a result, the grave of Yoshinobu was not found in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Zojo-ji Temple, which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family, but a circular tumulus similar to that of the Imperial family was built in Tanaka Cemetery.
This is because the Emperor Komei was a good imperial mausoleum, so he was impressed by the Emperor Komei ("Tokawa Yoshinobu no Konden" [biography of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA]).
When Yoshinobu was pardoned, he wrote that he was a roju (member of shogun's council of elders) Katsukiyo ITAKURA, who was a member of the shogun's council of elders in those days that he was in love with Yoshinobu who had dedicated his life to the former shogun's retainers who had been given the life of his life, and said, 'Even if he did not have a good life in his life, he was in a good manner,' and after that, he said that he was a member of the shogun's council of elders.
In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, there was a weak image of 'enemy escape' in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, but in recent years, the new modern political system was built after the Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), and there are some movements to reevaluate Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Taiga drama).
As with his father, Nariaki, he was fond of pork in the Satsuma Domain, and he was called 'Buda Ichi-sama' or 'Ichiba-sama' (a kind of pork and pork are fond of meat).
In his later years, he liked bread and milk, and when he was a shogun in the era of the shogun, he started to learn French language from Zhou Xianzhou (Keimang), who was in the age of the shogun when he was in the past.
It is famous as a camera many, but it seems that the technique of camera filming seems to have been not progressed.
He often wrote photographic magazine, but it is said that he did not adopt it.
In addition, his great-grandson Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA was a cameraman, and his photograph was discovered in the house of Yoshinobu by Yoshinobu and was published by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA and published by the editorial of the book.
He was a friend of his hobbies and was a younger brother of Akitake TOKUGAWA.
On December 3, 1854, he married Mikako ICHIJO (changed his name to Mikako MIGA after the Meiji Restoration.
She had a daughter (Keikoin no ike-ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike no suikei), but she died young on July 20, 1858.
After that, she did not have a child, and in the Meiji period, the 10th son and the 11th daughter who was born in the Meiji period, all had two concubines and two concubines.

Yoshihisa, a son of Yoshihisa, was a wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito who became the wife of Mitsumitsu TOKUGAWA and Takamatsunomiya Imperial Prince Nobuhito.

Note:
Nara Line is a railway line operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) from Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture, to Kyoto Station in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
The entire line is included in the suburbs of the cities.
Since the Kansai Main Line has its origin as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line, the official starting point is Kizu Station, but the train runs from Kyoto to Kizu (the number of the train numbers), and the inbound train is the same as that of the train number.
Except for the following routes, it is described in the section from Kyoto to Kizu unless special data are described.
The color of the line is brown (?), and it is said that the reason why the selection is the 'image of the two ancient capital' is the reason for the selection.
Administration (business: West Japan Railway Company (JR West) (JR West)
Railway distance (operating kilometers): 34.7 km
Track gauge: 1067 mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the starting and end of the station)
Double-tracked section: between Shinden Station and Uji Station, JR Fujinomori Station and Kyoto Station
Electrified section: entire line electrified (Electronic 1500V)
Block (railway) : automatic block system (double-tracked section), single-track automatic block system (single-track)
Safety device: Automatic Train Depot
Operation Control Center - Shin-Osaka General Center
Maximum speed: 110 km/h (double-tracked section); 95 km/h (single-track)
The Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) West Japan Railway Company (JR West) except Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) (Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
Although the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line, the entire section is located in Kyoto Prefecture, and there is no railway line in Nara Prefecture.
Although the Nara Railway was originally constructed by Nara Railway, the line between Kyoto and Nara was split into a part of the Kansai Railway Company (JR West) and was separated from the section between Osaka and Nagoya after it was merged into the Kansai Railway Company.
However, trains run from Kizu Station to the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line), and Nara Station in Nara Prefecture is operated by Nara Station.
JR West announced the nickname of the line (JR Kyoto Line and JR Kobe Line) in each line of the Urban Network on March 13, 1988, but the Nara Line was sent to the Nara Line.
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is located on the Kintetsu Nara Line, it is sometimes referred to as 'JR Nara Line.'
In the era of Japan National Railways (JNR), the name 'JNR Nara Line' was used as a guide and the English name of the board was also written as 'JR.'
The Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Naniwa, Nara and Nara, and the JR Nara Line is the Kintetsu Kyoto Line which is in rivalry with the JR Nara Line.
While the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel with many trains, the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 when JNR was electrified, and only the JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 105 was operated by a small local line with a few cars that had been operated by JNR National Railways.
However, after JR West was established, the JR West was established and after the establishment of the Urban Network Network, the four-car trains were converted into four-car trains (six cars were six-car trains), and the increase of rapid trains, such as 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' and so on, were rapidly improved by improving the transportation of the trains.
Today, it has a strong nature as a commuting and a line of travel from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Byodo-in Temple in Uji City, where Uji City is located along the line, and Joyo City, where it is located along the street.
However, it is a very circular shape to the east side of the Momoyama - Shinden section, and the section south of Joyo is located in parallel with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line running in parallel with the central part of the town, and the transportation of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line is still different.
Although the trains of Nara Train Depot are used for Nara Train Depot of the Osaka branch station, the station is managed by Kyoto Branch except for Kizu Station.
The J-Thru ICOCA, ICOCA, and the Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA of Tokai Railway Company (JR Central), and PiTaPa of KANSAI THRU PARU PASTHRU PASS can be used at all stations.
In the south of Joyo Station, it became a simple ticket gate to be used as a result of the mixed congestion of Mujin Station.
In 1984, the limited express 'Kuroshio' operated between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station was abolished by the Nara Line, Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line, and until 1991, only local trains were operated as local trains until 1991, but nowadays there were four types of local trains that were operated between Miyakoji Station and Rapid trains, Rapid trains, Rapid and local trains that were operated between Kyoto and Wakayama.
It is the nearest type of the Nara Line, and is mainly operated during the daytime mainly during the daytime.
Basically, local trains are operated between Uji Station and local trains at Uji Station because of the intervals of 30 minutes.
The nickname of 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' was decided by the public before the operation started.
As a tourist spot, many tourists use not only Japanese but also Japanese people but also tourists who are sightseeing spots but also from Japan.
All the trains are operated by JR West Series 221 and are operated with four-car trains or six cars.
The maximum speed of the double-track section is 110 km/h, and the maximum speed is operated at a maximum speed of 95 km/h.
Approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara Station, and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Nara.
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station on the way to Kyoto, and because they are different from Nara Miyakoji Rapid trains, they are slightly different from that of the inbound train.
During the three days of the new year, Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari Inari Station.
History
March 3, 2001: The operation started operating.
March 15, 2003: Due to the revision of the timetable revision, the station began to stop at Tofukuji Station and Tamamizu Station.
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours.
It also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture) where the 'Miyakoji Rapid Rapid Service' passes through the station.
All trains are operated in the Series 221 and are operated with four-car trains or six cars.
Basically, local trains are operated between Uji Station and local trains at Uji Station because of the intervals of 30 minutes.
Similar to the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above, the Yamatoji Line stopped at Hirayama Station where rapid trains stopped at the Yamatoji Line stopped at this station.
The stops of 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' were used until March 2001 when 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' was introduced, and the JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 117 was used in Kyoto and Uji and Joyo (initially stopping at the station), Kizu and Nara; however, the JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 117 was not used in the Nara Line.
In the morning and evening, there is a train that directly connects the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line.
It is mainly operated in the morning and night.
At first, only weekdays, it was operated on weekdays, but it was operated on Saturday and holidays due to the revision of the timetable revision on March 18, 2006.
Although trains stop at each station between Uji Station and Nara Station, there was a rapid train bound for Kizu Station in the vicinity of midnight due to the difference between the local trains running at Uji Station and the local trains running at Uji Station, but nowadays the local trains running on the local rapid trains stopped at the end of the section.
There are some trains that use JNR 103 series JNR 103 from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays, and all trains are operated on the 221 series 21.
During the morning rush hour there is a train that runs directly from the Yamatoji Line because it is convenient to operate during the morning rush hours.
Rapid trains on the Nara Line were used as a line line for preventing mistakes with rapid trains in the Yamatoji Line, but due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 2008, the type of rapid trains in the section was used as a greenhouse with green characters and the color of the section was not used as a color.
In the section on the north of Kamikoma Station, it is described in the case of the postmark of the station on the table of the station, which is written in purple characters on the table of the station postmark of the station on the north side of the station.
It runs between Kyoto Station and Uji, Joyo and Nara Station.
During the daytime the section between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station runs every 15 minutes, but the section between Joyo and Kizu, between Joyo Station and Kizu Station is 30 minutes.
Basically, trains are operated in the 103 series cars, but some trains are operated on the 221st.
In the early morning and late evening, there are trains that directly connect the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late evening.
In the past, there was a direct train with the Sakurai Line, but the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines due to the revision of September 4, 1994.
Although it was a special train, limited express trains were sometimes operated on the Nara Line.
In 1987 to 1988, the train was operated by the 'Kuroshi (train)' with the nickname of 'Kuroshi (train)' and from 1988 to 1989, by using the JNR series 381 series 'Kuroshio' (Electronic Train Series 381 and 381), the Kansai Main Line, the Kansai Main Line, the Hanwa Line and the Hanwa Line were operated via the Kansai Main Line, the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line.
In the Kinki Shinbun Newspaper published on January 6, 1998, there was an announcement that the limited express train operated on the Nara Line (commuter train with 381 series 381), but the plan was stopped after that.
It was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station as the Miyakoji Journ (Miyakoji Rapid Service between Kyoto and Nara), but no direct trains to the Sakurai Line are operated on the Sakurai Line except for special purposes.
In the middle of August, the Uji-gawa River Fireworks Fireworks held nearest to Uji Station, but since the schedule schedule is usually limited to the final schedule of the train schedule it is operated only between Kyoto and Uji only a local train that runs between 16:00 and late 16:00; all trains run between Kyoto and Uji are operated between Kyoto and Uji only 10 minutes.
Some local trains that arrive at and depart from Kizu Station are located here.
The special schedule of the New Year's Day at that time became completely different and Rapid trains stopped at each station between Kyoto and Uji Station, and the number of trains was increased to the Uji Station.
Depending on the year, some trains were operated back to Momoyama Station.
In 1992, direct trains bound for the Sakurai Line were extended to a rapid train on Saturdays and holidays mainly on Saturdays and holidays, and one hour was operated between Tenri Station and Tenri Station.
In addition, the special trains that are operated by the group can be used throughout Japan.
Particularly, when the Tenri Religious Festival held every October 26, the trains called 'special trains for the Tenri Line' are operated between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station on the Nara Line and the Yamatoji Line between Nara Station and Nara Station and Sakurai Line.
All of them belonged to Nara Train Depot.
JR West Suburban Train Series 221
It is common to use the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line, and there are two cars, four cars and six cars.
It is mainly operated by four-car trains and six cars of 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' or 'Rapid train,' but mainly four cars are operated on the Nara Line.
Two sets of two-car trains are used for holidays and holidays.
JNR 103 Series Limited Express
In addition to the Nara Line's Nara Line's Nara Line, the Nara Line Series 103 cars are operated not only in the Nara Line, but also for eight cars with two cars and eight cars are operated with the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during rush hours.

Keiji Bypass is a bypass of National Highway Route from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is designated as a plan for regional high-standard highways
The following are the Keiji Bypass of the Uryo Road and the Keiji Bypass of National Route 1 and National Route 24 as follows.
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway and is connected with the Kuridashi Interchange of the Meishin Expressway, the Kyoto City area and the Kyoto City City City City area, and connects with the direction of the Meishin Expressway, the Kurito, Nagoya City and Osaka City.
By the law, the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama Yodo Interchange are designated as National Highway Route 1 and National Route 478, and the Kumiyama Interchange (Keiji Bypass), the Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange and the Oyamazaki Junction, which are designated by the Minister of the National Highway 478 and National Highway Route 478, and the Taki Expressway (exclusive of the National Highway Highway Highway Expressway), and the National Highway Highway Highway Route No. 2, the Kyoto Prefectural Road No. 2 and the National Highway Highway Highway Route No. 2 are designated as the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Road and the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Route No. 2 and the Yodo Interchange of the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Route No. 24.
In the later plan, the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway was built in order to facilitate the delay of the Meishin Expressway, and the necessity of the construction of roads that have functions of the radiant radials and the Loop Line of Kyoto City as well as the Kyoto Bypass which was a bypass of National Highway Route 9 and the Keiji Bypass of National Route 9 was developed.
The Kyoto Jukan Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway have been designated National Highway 478 and continued to be maintained consistently.
According to the indication of the line, it is considered that it is a Keiji Bypass in the Seta JC-TT, and is considered to be a Keiji Bypass in Oyamazaki JCT.
Also, the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass are different from the ETC system, although there are differences between the tolls and the ETC system.
When there is no special note, the Keiji Bypass (from the Seta Higashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki JT) is mentioned as the name of the business route.

The Uji Tunnel is the longest 4,313 meters in the National Highway Route 1 and the tunnel is prohibited except for 500 meters in front of the Uji Higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange.
In the vicinity of the Kumiyama Junction, the film was shot in the film "Odoriuchi no Taiken" before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction.
When the distance between Seta Interchange and Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT, the Keiji Bypass is shorter than Meishin Expressway, the Keiji Bypass is more shorter than the Meishin Expressway, and when it runs on the maximum speed of the maximum speed of the station, the Keiji Bypass runs earlier than the Keiji Bypass via the Keiji Bypass.
Since there are no resting facilities such as the service area, the Meishin Expressway is often crowded with the Meishin Expressway, and the rest of the Meishin Expressway, the Seta Higashi and Oyamazaki rest facilities for the Meishin Expressway, the Otsu Service Area, and the Katsuragawa Park.
However, the structure of both the Seta and Oyamazaki Junction, which was established after the name of the god, is a very complicated structure (especially the structure of the JCTTT of Oyamazaki JCT, which is a complex complex of the road and is operated by the OYAMAZAKI JCT, is more complicated than that of the road running through the area where the road is operated by the road in a parallel.
When you go from Oyamazaki JTT to Suita and Osaka from the Oyamazaki JT, you can sometimes get along the Meishin Expressway and get off with the left-hand highway of Meishin Expressway.
In addition, since the curve and the sloping road have continued, the road has not always functioned as a bypass of the Meishin Expressway.
This road is a bypass of National Route 1 (general national road), so it is not a highway for high-speed Expressway.
When you pass the Keiji Bypass from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the direction of the Uji-gawa River, you must pass through the Uji Nishi Interchange when you pass through the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka.
This is because the Uji-higashi Interchange is an interchange of the Uji-higashi IC (Uji Higashi Interchange of the Uji).
For this reason, the general road section between the Uji Higashi Interchange and the Uji Nishi Interchange is often traffic during the time of commution.
This general road section is an unprovisional, so it is difficult to avoid traffic due to the fact that it is an unnecessary section for the VISS.

Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Shinshu sect (Shinshu Juha (Shinshu Juha sect), which is one of the Shinshu sect organizations, and is the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect along with the head temple of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple (formal name of the Hongan-ji school of the Jodo Shinshu sect).
The formal name of the temple was 'Hongan-ji Temple' until 1987, and after the same year, it was called 'Shinshu Honbyo Mausoleum.'
In order to distinguish it from Nishi Hongan-ji Temple in Shimogyo Ward, it is often called 'Higashi san.'
(Refer to the article on the history of Hongan-ji Temple before the split in the east and west of the capital.)
When the 12th head of Hongan-ji Temple, Kyonyo (光寿) (光寿) was given a temple territory in the east of Hongan-ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, Kyonyo was established in 1602 when Hongan-ji Temple was divided into two.
It is located in the present Karasuma-Shichijo, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, and is located in the east of the Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, which is located in Horikawa-Shichijo, and it came to be called Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.
In 1987, Hongan-ji Temple was dissolved as a religious corporation that had been in the Otani school and the Hitsukukukukukukukukukukuku, and it was integrated into the religious sects.
After that, the official name of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple was 'Shinshu Honbyo' (Shinshu Honbyo Mausoleum) (Honbyo Mausoleum means the Konpon Dojo, a place where believers heard the teachings of the founder of the sect and become a believer of Shinran).
There is also a meaning that the distinction between the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) Higashi Hongan-ji school and the Jodo Shinshu sect Higashi Hongan-ji School, which were separated from the Jodo Shinshu sect were differentiated from the Jodo Shinshu sect and that they were legitimate.

Amaterasu Omikami is a god (human) appearing in Japanese mythology.
In the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), when it was enshrined as a god of nature, the 'heaven' is called 'ameteru.'
It is one of the deities that deify the sun and are regarded as one of the deities of the Imperial family.
In the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is written as 天照大神神 (天照大神) in the Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters), and in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), it is written as 天下神神 (天照大神) and also written as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
He was also called Ohirume no Muchi no Kami.
In the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), there are several gods described in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), but in the "Kojiki," it is unified by the name of the god called 'Tensho Daijin' in the name of the god.
Although she was a goddess, there is a theory that she was actually a male god.
Since the name of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as "Kotai Jingu Gishiki," it is said that Takamimusubi (Takamimusubi no mikoto) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and Takamimusubi (Takamimusubi no mikoto) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and became the ancestor of the Imperial family.
In the Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amazume no Okami or Sumeramikami, and it is also referred to as Amasusashinimasu no Oomikami, when the name of the god is enshrined before the festival is held.
In academic documents today, the word 'Amaterasu' and katakana are used as a custom.
There is also a theory that it was written in ancient times as 天照太神.
Description in mythology
In "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), when Izanagi came back from the land of Izanami, he was born when he washed off the impurities of the dead, and when he washed his left eyes.
He was born from the right eye and was called Mikoshi along with Susanoo who was born from his nose.
At that time, Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to rule Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Susanoo who was delegated to Kaibara continued to cry that he would go to Nenokuni where Izanami had lived, so he was expelled by Izanami.
Susanoo met his older sister Amaterasu Omikami, before he went to Nenokuni (the Nine Kingdom), and he went to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), but Amateru Daishin was afraid that his younger brother came back to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven) and waited for him.
In order to prove the purity of Susanoo, the three goddesses were born from the real reality of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and Susano declared the victory of the victory in the battle.
He was born from the real appearance of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and was regarded as a child of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and the following five deities are the deities of the following five gods.
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Hikutsuhikone
Kusunokuten
Susano who was frightened by this, worked in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and as a result, Amaterasu Omikami hid herself in Ama no Iwato (heavenly rock cave).
In the middle of the world, there were various misfortunes in the world.
(The eight hundred million deities including Yagorogi no mikoto and Amenokoyane no mikoto succeeded in making Amaterasu Omikami, the god of Chichibu-no-kami, the god of Chichibu-no-kami, the god of Chichibu-no-kami, the god of Chichibu-no-kami, and the god of eight hundred thousand koku was expelled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
He sent his son Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no nakatsukuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains) to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
It was suppressed by Ashihara no nakatsukuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was descended to descend to Ninigi who was the grandson of Ninigi during the time of Ninigi.
interpretation
In the mythology, Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be the god of the nation because he was born earlier than that of Amatsu kami (Takamimusubi no mikoto) who was born earlier than him, and there is a scene in which Amaterasu Omikami was in accordance with the instructions of the god.
There is also a view that the shrine was deified as a god of ancient shrine maidens.
It is also called 'Hime' (日女女) and refers to miko (miko who serve the sun goddess) who served the sun god.
Although the sun god was originally a male god, there is a theory that the shrine maiden who served was identified with the sun god was identified with the sun god and became a goddess.
There is also a theory that this goddess was established in the era of Empress Jito, who was a female emperor, and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami at present.
It is pointed out that the birth of the sun and Tsukuyomi was based on Taoism in the "Ryoho Gofu Jo" (Commentary on the Five Past of the Sacred Treasures) of Taoism and the "Ryoho Gofu" (before the sixth century), which was written in the "Ryoho Gofu" (before the sixth century), and the "Kyoikyo" (before the sixth century), and that it was strongly influenced by Taoism.
In addition, the theory of the Ise-jingu Shrine, the Ise-jingu Shrine, the Ise-jingu Shrine, the Saigu, the Saigu, and the Saigu, the Saikan, the Saikan, the Saikan, the Shigi no Mura no Miyatsuko, the Miginu (purification), and the other are the same as those of the five colors, and Usukinou (white silk fabric) of the five colors, and the Ojingu Shrines.
According to comparative mythology, the birth mythology of Amaterasu Omikami was almost equal to that of the ancient mythological mythology which records the ancient period (3 to 4 centuries), which was recorded earlier than the ancient times.
Also, there is a myth that it is regarded as the sun and the moon because it spread to Japan along with ethnic groups in the earlier period of the history.
In "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), there is a theory that the shrine was transformed into the third stage.
The following are the events and contents of the movement.
645: Taika Reforms
Before that, the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
The sun itself is 'Hijin no kami' (the god of the sun).
A male god called 'Ameru,' was widely enshrined there.
In the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines such as 'Akamasu-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima and 'Issunimasu Amateru' in Harima, 'Amitamiteru' in Tanba.
In addition, the term "Otoko-kama" is also used as the name of Amenohama, a grandchild of Amaterasu and Amenokari is also the founder of the Owari clan, the Tsunamori clan, and the Kaibe clan.
In addition, the younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi, and the great-grandfather of Emperor Jinmu.
672: The Jinshin War
Ohihirume no Muchi no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Muchi (お日日日日日本津女神神神神神神神神神神神神神神神神神神神神神女女, '大日日日日日本神神' or 'Tanata no Tamatsume' (Tanatatsume)
In this case, it is interpreted that the enshrined deity is Ohirume no Mikoto, a goddess, and there is an interpretation that it is the 'ameteru' of a snake.
698: Kotai-jingu Shrine was established.
The 'Amaterasu (the Sun Goddess)' and 'the ancestor of the Imperial family.'
She was a goddess.
Emperor Jito was modeled after the Emperor Jito, and it was created from the nature of the god and a humanistic god.
Even after that, the term 'Tenteru' other than the Koto-shin (ancestor honored as god) was referred to as 'Ama no teru.'
For example, in "Sarashina Nikki" (Tarashina Diary), it is written as '天照御神' (1060), and '天照神' (天照神) is also read as 'Ameru,' and also in the 'Ame no Sumeruhirume no muchi' in "Sendai Kujihongi" (Ancient Japanese History).
1880 - 1881, a fierce dispute occurred over the enshrined deities of the Shinto Jimukyoku Bureau in Hibiya in Tokyo.
In the Shinto Jimukyoku (the Bureau of Divinations), it was decided that the three deities were built as the enshrined deities of the Bureau of Divination, the Takamimusubi no kami, Takamimusubi no kami and the Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) should enshrine four deities but the Izumo school should be integrated into the world of 'Yuikai' (the world).
However, the 'Ise school' which was the center of the Shinto Jimukyoku was the 'presidence' that Amaterasu Omikami was the 'presidence' that ruled the two worlds of Kenyu and the other gods insisted that the other gods were not a subject.
In the end, there were various views such as 'As the Izumo school had a grudge that had continued since the reign of the gods, he would kill Senke Sonfuku, who had a bad mind in the Imperial family.'
Before long, the controversy was taken over by Emperor Meiji's decision, and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was positioned as the highest position in the position of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
In addition, it is said that the government recognized that the modern nation directly controlled the people by the Fukushin Shinto.
Refer to the controversy of the enshrined deities of State Shinto Jimukyoku (the Bureau of Shinto Shrines).
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA introduced Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in his own novel to his own novel, and he used another name 'Ohihirume no Sumeru' (also known as Ohirume no Ki).
Since the term 'Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess)' was used as the name of the emperor because the word 'Amaterasu Omikami' was written in the form of the sun god or natural god, it was not necessary to use the word 'Dainichihi hirume no Ki.'
In fact, there are many novels written by AKUTAGAWA that were not corrected and copied by the command, and there are many cases where they were not able to be able to be correct.
In 1926, Masaatsu YASUOKA (1898 - 1983), who established the Kinkei Gakuin School (1926-1983), said, 'Japan has the belief of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is the ideal to make the world light of Japanese spirit.
The word 'Izana' in Izanagi and Izanagi's words means 'what is the world's awaken,' and if the term is changed, it is an ideal to become a pioneer of the world.'
Shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami
The shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami are called Kamimeijinja Shrines throughout the country and the main shrine is the inner shrine (Kotai-jingu Shrine) of the Jingu Shrine (Ise-jingu Shrine).
The Kotai-jingu Shrine is a Shinto shrine that enshrines Yata no Kagami (the eight-span mirror), one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family, and is enshrined as a goshintai (object of worship housed in a Shinto shrine).
In most shrines throughout Japan, the shinsatsu (shinsatsu for the gods) of Kotai-jingu Shrine (Tensho Kotai-jingu Shrine) are distributed in most shrines throughout Japan.
The term "daimyo" refers to the term "daimyo" (daimyo) changed from "daimyo" (daimyo) to "daimyo" (daimyo's lord).
It refers to a person who was very famous as a Dokuroku (a person who plays the role of a player).
It is a small name, which is used to become a pair of things.
It originally referred to the people who had power in the region.
In the samurai society, the term came to mean a samurai who owned many territories or the lower part of the territory.
In the Muromachi period, shugo strengthened their own territories and became shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords).
In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), a powerful feudal lord who established a strong control of his territory, appeared and was called Kokujin (local samurai) or Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period (period of warring states).
In the Edo period, the term was mainly used to refer to samurai families that were given 10,000 koku (crop yields) to the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
Among the samurai who were under the control of 10,000 koku (crop yields) under the control of the bakufu were called jikan (immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods).
In addition, the feudal lords shared the characteristics of the feudal lords in China and were also called feudal lords in accordance with lords as feudal lords of China.
In this section, it is mainly described in detail in detail in the modern daimyo in the Edo period.
Refer to the article of the "Shugo-daimyo" and "sengoku-daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period)."
Daimyo in the Edo period
The daimyo in the Edo period were determined by the social standing of social standing and official ranks, the official rank of kokudaka (crop yield) and the post of the post and the shikoseki (consultant) in the Edo period.
Firstly, it is classified as tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lord) who were retainers of the Tokugawa shogunate before the Battle of Sekigahara due to the relationship between the Tokugawa shogunate and the Tokugawa shogunate through the relationship between the Tokugawa shogunate and the Tokugawa Shogunate family, mainly served as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who was a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara.
When the Shogun family line was extinguished, the Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family), which were allowed to use the Tokugawa family as well as the Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) were established, and the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA and the tenth son Yorinobu TOKUGAWA were appointed to the Mito Domain by the Kishu Domain and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA as the 11th son of the Tokugawa family.
In addition, he appointed Hideyasu YUKI, the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA, to the Echizen Domain and a daimyo (feudal lord) of the Tokugawa clan throughout the country.
In addition, the fudai daimyo (a hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who had established the foundation of the Tokugawa Shogun family were placed as Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) and secured the military power of the bakufu, and he was appointed important posts centered around the Tairo (chief minister) of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to support the shogunate government in order to maintain the military power of the bakufu.
Fudai daimyo were relatively low, and the Hikone Domain of the Ii clan, which was the head of fudai daimyo (a hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), was given a relatively large amount of territory of 50,000 koku, but the Torii clan and the Sakakibara clan, the Honda clan, and the Ogasawara clan, which maintained more than 100,000 koku during the Edo period, were held by the Sakai clan, the Abe clan, the Abe clan, the Horiizawa clan, the Horida clan, and the Toda clan, and only a few fudai daimyo who had kept more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period.
This came to be used for separation of power and military power.
After the Battle of Sekigahara, tozama daimyo were daimyo who were subordinate to the Tokugawa family and many families fought against the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara.
However, he was strongly concerned about the shogunate and actively actively actively worked as intelligent activities, and he was severely punished by being deprived of his fief when he was afraid of his misfortunes or a scheme.

In addition, the status of daimyo was divided into the social status of daimyo (daimyo) who had more than one koku or more than one koku or more than one koku of kokudaka (crop yield), and those with a castle were called joshukaku (lord of a castle) or jinya (castle status of a castle), and when daimyo visited the Edo Castle, daimyo were allowed to stay in the Edo-jo Castle, they were classified into the status of the room in accordance with the social status of a daimyo (feudal lord).
For more information, refer to the article on the shikoseki (seat for the vassals of the Tokugawa shogunate).
Daimyo were not allowed to have the status of daimyo (feudal lord), but the daimyo with a fief of 100,000 koku was not allowed to have a territory in most cases, and they had territories around the castle town.
In extreme cases, one village was divided into another feudal lord and the other (shokyu [salary]).
Although daimyo were more than 10,000 koku (crop yields), the Kiregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was worth 5,000 koku.
This was because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the Buke Shohatto (laws for samurai families) and the Sankinkotai system (a system in which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In addition, in the end of the Edo period, daimyo were appointed to the post of the officer who was called oteiden, and in the end of the Edo period, they were always suffering from financial difficulties.
The word "daimyo" (daimyo in the Edo period) was used as a word for daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).

It is said that in the Sengoku period the distinction of the meaning of the sound of the sound was weak, and the term 'taimei' was often used to refer to 'taimei.'
The two sounds of 'daimyo' and 'taimei' are also included in the Japanese-Portuguese dictionary written in the early 17th century, but the distinction between words is not clear, and the distinction of the word is not clear.
