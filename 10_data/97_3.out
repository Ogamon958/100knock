Brief History
626 - born in 626.
Emperor Kogyoku (July 14, 645 - July 12, 644) was formally installed as Crown Prince.
Narimichi (August 24, 661 - August 24, 661) was a name of a system.
On February 20, 686, he succeeded to the throne.
On January 7, 672, he died at the age of 46 at the age of 46.
(According to the "Fuso Ryakki" (Diary of Fuso FUNAGO), there is a theory that he died of illness after he died of disease, and it is said that there is a theory that he was killed by the fact that he was not able to go back to Mt. Nagareyama, and there is a theory that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu.)
Since Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time, it is one of the political history in the middle of the seventh century that Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne in the middle of the seventh century.
There are several theories about this theory.
It can be said that he was in charge of the power of the Emperor Tenmu.
In other words, Emperor Tenmu, who is believed to have been a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, was a younger brother of Emperor Jomei, and there is a theory that Emperor Tenchi was born before his marriage to Emperor Jomei, and he was a younger brother of his father.
It is certain that the year of Emperor Tenchi was calculated based on the year of his birth based on the age of the year of Emperor Tenchi, according to the description of the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the year of his birth was calculated based on the year of Emperor Tenmu's death in the year of Emperor Tenmu.
However, there is no contradictory contradictions in the same period and there are many historical materials.
On the other hand, there is a theory that 'he was a younger brother of his father, but his older brother who was a younger brother of his older brother who was a younger brother of his older brother, but he said that the age of the Emperor Jomei was 16 according to "Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)", but the age of his father Emperor Jomei died at the age of 16 in the age of 16.
As a result, the year of his birth was adopted in 1414 by the Imperial Prince Shoo who was the heir of the Imperial Family was adopted by the Emperor.
In ancient times, there was no objection to the fact that there was no precedent in ancient times, and it was not unusual that the Emperor was in the era of the Emperor Tenmu's reign, but he did not ascend to the throne.
In order to avoid the difference of the difference of the difference of the difference of the difference of the difference of the errors was considered.
Some argue that it is pointed out that it was written as 'Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)' and the history of history is different from the fact that it was compiled in the same period.
(Refer to the article of 'Emperor Tenmu')
There is a theory that the Isshi Incident was a coup of Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku), and Naka no Oe no Oe was expelled from the position of his position.
In recent years, the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe and SOGA no Iruka is relatively relatively good and it is pointed out that the basic policy was similar to the policy.
Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji attempted to kill Iruka no Iruka (Iruka no Iruka).
In addition, according to the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan), it was recognized that the theory was advocated by the Taika Reforms.
In addition, there is no reason for the reason that the Soga clan and the IrIruka clan were not expelled after the abdication of Emperor Kogyoku and they can also be explained even after the coup d'etat of the Soga clan and the Iruka Clan.
There is a theory that the enthronement of the enthronement of the enthronement of the Emperor Tenchi.
There is a theory that Emperor Kotoku was described in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) as a wife of Emperor Kotoku, who was described as a wife of the wife of the Emperor Kotoku, and there is a possibility that she had a relationship with her sister, Tenchi no Himemiko and her relationship with Chiten.
Although she was allowed to marry her half brother and marriage with her younger sister, she was not allowed to have a love affair with the people who were not allowed to have a relationship with the people of the time, and she had a close relationship with the Emperor Kotoku who was in love with her older brother Chisato NAKAJIMA, who was a younger brother of the same mother.
After the death of Emperor Saimei in the death of Empress Saimei, a princess who succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous emperor succeeded to the throne.
According to "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), there is a theory that a person who was a princess of a man who was called 'Nakatsu no Mikoto', and it is interpreted that the Emperor was a successor to the throne until the enthronement of the sun goddess.
There is a theory that it is not clear that she was called 'Chushinno Mikoto,' but there is a theory that it is not clear that she was given only a special title but also a special name for the Empress Saimei or Empress Saimei.
It is difficult to confirm the nature of political history and historical materials, but it is difficult to think that the study of archaeologies and the study of archaeologies have been conducted by the study of archaeologies.

Keiji Bypass is a bypass that runs from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama-cho, Kusatsu County, Kyoto Prefecture, which runs through Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture.
It is designated as a plan for the high-speed high-speed high-speed high-speed high-speed high-speed construction project.
The following article describes the Keiji Bypass on the Keiji Bypass and the National Highway 24 Bypass on National Route 1 and National Route 24 as follows:
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway, and is connected to the city of Otsu City, Kyoto City and Osaka City and the city of Osaka City and Osaka City and the direction of Osaka City and Osaka City in the direction of Osaka City and Osaka City.
The Act on National Highway 478 and Kumiyama Interchange (Keiji Bypass Bypass, Kumiyama Bypass, Kumiyama Bypass and Oyamazaki Interchange are designated as National Highway Route 478) and National Highway Route 478 is a special highway for the National Highway Highway Route 478 (under National Highway 478) which is operated by National Highway Highway Route 478 and the National Highway Route 478 (under National Highway 478).

In the vicinity of Kumiyama Kumiyama Route, it was shot by a film called "Otori no Utsu" (The Olympic Corp), which was completed before the opening of the movie theater.
Seta Interchange - The distance of the distance between Oyamazaki Interchange and JJ-JC Interchange is slightly shorter than the Meishin Expressway, and the number of Kyobashi Bypass is slightly shorter than that of the Meishin Expressway.
In addition, there are many facilities such as the rest of the parks, such as the rest of the parking facilities such as the rest of the parks, and the rest of the parking facilities of the Otsu area (Higashi Seta Interchange of the Meishin Expressway) and Oyamazaki Higashi Oyamazaki Higashi Oyamazaki Station (where the rest of the parking facilities are located, and there are two locations).
However, the structure of the section between Higashi and Oyamazaki was established after the name of the name of the name of the god, and the structure of the J-J-J-J-J-TC (especially the Oyamazaki section of the Oyamazaki Road is more complicated and more complicated than that of the park).
There is a possibility that it is difficult to stop the Meishin Expressway, which is operated by the Oyamazaki Bus Company (JR West) and the Osaka Loop Expressway through the direction of Suita and Osaka.
In the middle of the way, there are many lanes and slopes that run through the curves, and there is no function to function as a bypass for the Meishin Expressway.

When the road is located from the east side of the Uji-gawa River and the direction of the Keiji Bypass in the direction of the Uji Bypass from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the west of the Uji Interchange.
This is because the interchange of the Uji Interchange of the Uji Higashi IC IC IC has been detected.
For this reason, it is often difficult to pass the general road between Uji Interchange and Uji, which is operated during the period of commuting commution.
This general road is not equipped with the intersection, so it is difficult to avoid the traffic due to the fact that the road is not able to pass through the intersection, so it is difficult to avoid the driver.
