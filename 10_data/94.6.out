<unk> was a Zen monk who lived in the early Kamakura period .
Founder of the Soto sect .
It was also called <unk> in his later years .
In the same religious doctrine , he was honorifically called Koso .
His posthumous name was <unk> Daishi ( priest ) .
Generally , it is called Dogen Zenji .
It is said that he spread the manners and cleaning manners and manners of eating meals in Japan .
There is also a theory that he first brought back <unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) .
Although there are many questions about Dogen 's birth , there are various theories on the fact that he was born in the direct line of Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO ( MINAMOTO no Michichika and Michichika KOGA ) , who was Naidaijin ( Minister of the Interior ) .
According to an established theory , he was born as a son of Michichika and FUJIWARA no Ishi , a daughter of FUJIWARA no Motofusa ( Motofusa ) MATSUDONO , who was the daughter of Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) Motofusa MATSUDONO ( FUJIWARA no Motofusa ) , but recently , the theory has become widely accepted that he was the biological child of Michitomo HORIKAWA , who was the foster father .
There is also a theory that Michichika 's son MINAMOTO no Michimune , MINAMOTO no Michimune , and Michiteru KOGA were his father .
According to his biography " <unk> , " he lost his father ( Michichika ) at the age of three , lost his mother at the age of eight , and was adopted by his older paternal half - brother , Michitomo HORIKAWA .
According to one theory , after the death of his parents , there was a story that he wanted his maternal uncle Moroie MATSUDONO ( former Regent and Minister of the Center ) to be adopted as an heir of the Matsudono family , but it is also said that Dogen , who felt the impermanence of the world , declined .
There is a theory that Shinran , the founder of the Jodo Shinshu Sect , met each other with his maternal relatives , but there is no evidence .
There is a theory that the volume of his work " Shobogenzo " ( Treasury of True Teaching ) was written for Shinran .
In 1213 , he visited his maternal uncle <unk> on Mt. Hiei .
In 1214 , he became a priest with the title of Tendai - zasu ( head priest of the Tendai sect ) , <unk> , and took the name of Dogen .
In 1215 , he studied the Tendai sect under <unk> of Onjo - ji Temple .
He studied under Myozen , a disciple of Eisai at Kennin - ji Temple in 1217 .
In 1223 , along with Myozen , he went over Mt. Mimoro from Hakata to the Southern Sung Dynasty and received Inka ( Certification of spiritual achievement ) from Nyojo Tendo of the Soto sect .
In 1228 , he returned to Japan .
He founded Kosho - ji Temple in Fukakusa , Kyoto in 1233 .
At that time , he was oppressed by Mt. Hiei .
In July 1243 , he was invited by Yoshishige HATANO , jito ( manager and lord of manor ) of Echizen Province , and moved to Echizen <unk> no sho .
On the way , in response to the invitation of Nobutsuna SASAKI , the feudal lord of Kutsuki - mura village , Kutsuki - mura , he stood at Kutsuki - mura village ( the origin of Kosho - ji Temple ( Takashima City ) ) .
He founded Osaragi - ji Temple in Kasamatsu in 1244 .
In 1246 , he changed the name of Osaragi - ji Temple to Eihei - ji Temple and changed his pen name to <unk> .
At this time , he went down to Kamakura to invite the regent Tokiyori HOJO , Yoshishige HATANO and others .
The period of edification in Kamakura lasted for half a year , but it became the beginning of pure Zen in the Kanto region .
In 1253 , he handed over Eihei - ji Temple to his disciple Koun Ejo , and died at the residence of his disciple <unk> <unk> ( Takatsuji - dori Street , Kyoto City ) , and at the age of 54 ( 53 years old ) .
It is said that the cause of his death was <unk> .
Even if it was completed at a certain level , it was not to attain Buddhahood , and even if it would become a Buddha , it was the essence of Buddhahood ( <unk> ) , which was the essence of Buddhahood ( <unk> ) , followed by Shaka , and insisted that it was the supreme practice of mediation ( <unk> ) .
Many of the Kamakura Buddhism agreed on the Mappo - shiso ( the end of the Dharma ) , but according to " Shobogenzo " ( Treasury of True Teaching ) , ' we can say that this word is not true .
It is a hoben ( expedient ) for a period of time when Shozo succeeded to Buddhism for a while .
Only the truth is true .
<unk> ã€‚
He was not good at all the monks who had been alive .
There is also a reflection of the mysterious nature of Mt. Asama , which makes it calm .
It is to mean that Buddha , precepts , and so on , and all sentient beings and living things can be seen in the world .
It became a Buddhist priest .
He pointed out that he would not be able to be able to do anything , and that he would not be good at disciples of Shakyamuni 's disciples , and denied Mappo ( Age of the Final Dharma ) and Mappo ( Age of the Final Dharma ) .

Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum , located in <unk> - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture , is a storage facility for steam locomotives managed by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) .
On October 10 , 1972 , it was founded by Japan National Railways for commemorating the 100th anniversary of the inauguration of the Japan National Railways , using the <unk> of Umekoji Engine , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , and it was the first Japanese facility to preserve the steam locomotive that had been supported by Japan 's railway transportation in the first century , and to preserve it as an important cultural property .
With the division and privatization of Japan National Railways in 1987 , JR West succeeded it .
In addition , this facility is a regular train yard ( Umekoji Ward ) , and it is also conducted by the JNR <unk> diesel locomotives owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway and the JNR <unk> diesel locomotives .
In the first place , this facility came to be established as a result of the fact that it rapidly disappeared from the latter half of the 1960s to preserve steam locomotives .
At first , Oyama Ward , which was located on the premises of Koyama Station , Tochigi Prefecture , was the most likely candidate for the preservation organization , but as it was located in ' the central part of Japan , ' Umekoji Ward ( at that time ) was officially selected as a preservation body in 1970 .
The purpose of storage cars was to be selected as the oldest car ( if possible ) existing in principle , but there were also some cars that were supposed to be preserved at first like C62 Type 2 .
The facilities were derived from " Steam Locomotive Museum " which used a fan - shaped <unk> and a <unk> of the former Umekoji Engine Depot , " and " Materials Museum " which was relocated and restored the former Nijo Station building .
The <unk> was made of ferroconcrete constructed in 1914 , and it was designated as a national important cultural property along with the <unk> ceiling ( completed in 1915 ) and the <unk> Line .
In the same year , 2004 , it was preserved for the civil engineering site for the study of Kokkagakkai .
In 2006 , the former Nijo Station building ( exhibition hall ) , a model - shaped steam locomotive and a set of tools of steam locomotives , which had been preserved by JR West , were designated as quasi - railway monuments .
The former Nijo station building was constructed in 1904 by imitating Heian - jingu Shrine in consideration of its scenery , although it was the oldest wooden building that was constructed by the Kyoto Railway Company as its headquarters .
The Kyoto Railway was nationalized in 1907 , and later it was used as a station building for JR West , but in 1996 , it ended up its role as a station building when the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) and Hanazono Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) were elevated , and it was moved to the main building and reconstructed in 1997 as the entrance hall , and used the old ticket room as a museum .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
In the fan - shaped magazine , the 16 - car steam locomotive manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period , which was produced by the Taisho period , eighteen - car steam locomotives ( 16 - car locomotives at the beginning of the museum ) and 18 - car locomotives ( 16 - car ) were displayed .
At the beginning of the opening , it was generally preserved in a dynamic state , and there was a registration of a car for 15 ryo , except for 2 cars of Type <unk> and 239 , but later , it was revised to be preserved in 2006 , and now it has become 7 - ryo ( seven - car ) .
Among the five cars , five cars are still registered , and 2 cars ( C57 <unk> , 56 <unk> ) are served on the main line , such as ' Yamaguchi ' ( train ) on the Yamaguchi Line and ' Kita Biwako ' ( train ) on the Hokuriku Main Line .
Although there are some registration machines other than these two locomotives , they can not run on the main line because they are not fully inspected .
In addition , the ' SL Steam Locomotive No . <unk> ' ( SL Steam Locomotive No . <unk> ) is operated on the track of the museum by the <unk> of the museum .
This display route was once extended from the depot to the north of the site where a large - sized car parking lot was now available ( a rest facility and a park once stood ) , but it was moved to the north of the former Nijo Station building building , and it was changed to a side of the Sagano Line , along with the relocation of the former Nijo Station building .
Even now , it has a function as an organization , and is also connected to the operating line .
After the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company was closed , it was also maintained by steam locomotives .
Plum trees
The name comes from ' Ume ' meaning Umekoji .
Except for the C62 C62 Type No . <unk> , which had been designated in 1976 , all of them were designated as quasi - quasi - quasi - railway monuments along with the number of cars and the <unk> of conservative tools in 2006 .
The procedure to be transferred from the former affiliated organization in 1972 is taken from the former organization organization .
" <unk> " has been preserved in Umekoji since it has been preserved .

Shomyo is one of the Japanese traditional music .
It is a religious music that is used for rituals in Buddhist scriptures and Buddhist scriptures .
In Japan , it is also called <unk> or <unk> .
It is written as <unk> in old Chinese characters .
It is one of the fields of ancient India .
The term " Shomyo " refers to five fields of learning : Shomyo ( phonology , grammar , and grammar ) , <unk> ( science ) , <unk> ( science ) , Inmyo ( learning ) , Inmyo ( learning ) ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , and <unk> ( ethics ( ethics ) , and Buddhist scholars ) .
It was introduced to Japan along with the introduction of Buddhism .
In 754 , a Buddhist memorial service was held at the time of the ceremony to consecrate the Great Buddha of Todai - ji Temple , and it is believed that Shomyo was actively practiced in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai handed down the Buddhist Shomyo and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and the Shingon Shomyo .
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect also have their own Buddhist Shomyo , which is still passed down .
Since Shomyo ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) was handed down by <unk> , there were no scores .
Therefore , the teaching of the school was extremely difficult .
Later , <unk> , which was a musical score , was invented .
In addition , depending on each school , there are differences in terms of professional terms such as hakase .
However , the meaning of hakase is a reference to the chanting of Buddhist hymns , and it is necessary to learn the chanting of Buddhist hymns ( also called <unk> ) , and it is necessary to maintain and inherit the school from the teacher to his disciples .
Therefore , it was necessary to educate instructors and successors .
With various conditions , many schools were abolished .
The Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) was passed down by Saicho , which led to the foundation of Saicho 's own development .
After Saicho , Ennin and <unk> became prosperous .
Ryonin , the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu , is known as the restorer of the temple .
In 1109 , Ryonin built Raigo - in Temple ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) in Ohara , Kyoto .
Its sango ( literally , " mountain name " ) , which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple , was <unk> , which was the origin of Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) in Ohara .
Later , two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the training hall of Ohara School Shomyo Shomyo .
In addition , <unk> HARA later had no school , and in Ohara there was a statement of the two schools .
Later , <unk> restored Ohara Shomyo .
It was founded by Tankai to establish a flow based on the new music theory .
After that , he did not have the center of the Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) and was handed down to the present Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu sect , Jodo sect , and Jodo Shinshu Shomyo ( chanting of the Buddhist chant ) are the lineage of Tendai Shomyo .
The mantra chanting of the Shingon sect is based on Kukai 's tradition , and has been passed down to the present day .
It was after Shinga that the chanting of Buddhist hymns had been systematized .
It can be said that Kancho was the restorer of the temple .
He worked for the music and maintenance of Shomyo ( Buddhist hymns ) .
Up to the Kamakura period , there were many schools , but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakuho by four schools ( <unk> - ryu , Shin - <unk> - ryu , Daigo - ryu , and Nakagawa Daishin - ryu ) .
The reading of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared from the Edo period .
The <unk> - ryu , Shin - in , Daigo - ryu and Daigo - ryu were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
At present , it is divided into <unk> Shomyo ( Chishaku - in Temple in Kyoto ) , <unk> Shomyo ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) ( Hase - dera Temple in Nara ) , <unk> ( Mt. Koya , Kogi Shingon sect of Kyoto ) .
The names of Chisan Shomyo , Buzan Shomyo ( Shingi Shingon sect ) , Shingon sect Buzan school , Buzan school , Buzan school , Shingon sect Buzan school , and both of which were originally derived from the Nakagawa Taijo School .
Raiyu adopted the school of Daigo .
In 1583 , when Negoro - ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and fell into decline , the two schools of Chisan and Buzan came to form a group based on the old school of Daigo .
Its characteristics are the ' debate ' of Buzan 's Buzan school ' and ' Shomyo ' ( Shomyo ) .
The <unk> School ( Kogi Shingon sect ( Kogi Shingon sect ) ) , which was based on the Nakagawa <unk> School .
The Nakagawa Daishin - ryu school was founded by <unk> of Nakagawa - ji Temple in Nara .
In the Joei era ( 1232 - 1233 ) , <unk> of Mt. Koya and Sanbo - in Temple moved their base to Mt. Koya .
Later , the name of Mt. Koya was changed to Nanzan - san , which was prefixed by the name of Nanzan - san .
It is also referred to as the <unk> School and the <unk> School .
The music of Heikyoku , Yokyoku , folk song , Joruri ( dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment ) , Joruri ( dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment ) , and so on were transformed into Shomyo .
It was greatly influenced by the melody melody .

The reason why Emperor Tenchi did not ascend the throne for a long time was one of the mystery in the history of politics in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories regarding this .
It was in consideration of Emperor Tenmu 's power that recommended Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , it is wrong that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is based on the theory that Emperor Kogyoku gave birth to Emperor Jomei before he married Emperor Jomei , and that he was the maternal half - brother of Emperor Tenchi .
In fact , if calculating the year of birth based on the year of Emperor Tenmu 's death in some history books of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , Emperor Tenmu became older .
However , there are no contradictions between the same historical materials , and there are many historical materials that have the age of 8 to 9 .
On the other hand , there is an opinion that ' although the father is different from his father , the younger brother is too bad , ' and there is a negative opinion that ' the age of the Emperor Tenchi is based on the age of Tenchi , ' however , the age of the Emperor Tenchi at the age of 16 is described in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the age of the Emperor Jomei , who was the father of the Emperor Jomei , died at the age of 16 .
Therefore , the real year of birth was 614 , which was adopted by Honcho koin jounroku ( the Emperor 's family tree ) and so on .
In ancient times , there was no interregnum ( in fact , Emperor Tenchi and Empress Jito , who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu , did not succeed to the throne immediately .
It was because of the error .
There is also a view that the theory of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) was pointed out to be " <unk> " or " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the other historical books were compiled , so there is another opinion that they were not identical .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age . ' )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat by Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and it is said that Naka no Oe no Oji was driven out of power .
Recently , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good , and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of Naka no Oe no Oji .
In this way , Prince Naka no Oe no Oji did not have a motive to kill Iruka .
In addition , the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) has been <unk> , and this theory came to be advocated .
In this theory , the Soga clan other than Iruka had not been expelled even after the coup for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the Soga clan other than Iruka , therefore , they received attention because they can be explained in other points .
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to the opposition from the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi .
This suggests that Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , pointed out the relationship between her wife Hashihito no Himemiko ( younger maternal half - sister of Emperor Tenchi ) and Emperor Tenchi .
Although his love and marriage were permitted between her paternal half - brothers and sisters , it was interpreted that she was not allowed to have a love relationship between her maternal half - sister and her maternal half - sister , but in the case of a rainbow in the sky of <unk> <unk> , she was persuaded by her uncle Karu no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and she was persuaded to have her marry her husband , Karu no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and so on , and the scene of Arima was infuriated .
After the death of Empress Saimei , Hashihito no Himemiko succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the empress of the previous emperor , but there is a theory that the records were deleted for some reason .
This is based on the " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) that says that ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' came from Hashihito no Himemiko , and the ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' can be interpreted as the interim emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .
If Hashihito no Himemiko is referred to as ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto , ' there is also a theory that she was the Empress Saimei , but there is no definite evidence .
It is difficult to prove the nature of the political history and the restrictions of historical materials , and it is possible to prove it , but the development of research in the future , including cooperation with archaeological results , and so on .
Poems
He was also a poet of the Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) .
In the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu ( the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Poets ) , the following poems were given to him as the Taiso ( Taiso ) of the Heian dynasty , and the following poem was added at the beginning .
Autumn rice fields , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Also from the Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) , one of the following poems were selected .
The hill of Mt. Unebi is very fond of Mt. Unebi , and if Mt. Miminashi and Miminashi have come from the age of the gods , it looks like a little <unk> .
Saion - ji Temple was a court noble who was descended from the Fujiwara clan .
The family was descended from the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan , and its social standing was the Seiga family .
The Toin family and the Imadegawa family ( Kikutei family ) were separated from the Saionji family .
The Saionji clan , a samurai family in Iyo Province , was also a powerful branch of the Saionji family who used the family name of Saionji .
Its kamon ( family crest ) is Hidari mitsudomoe ( three comma - shaped figures ) .
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Suemichi , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane .
When Kintsune SAIONJI , the great - grandson of Michisue , married MINAMOTO no Yoritomo 's niece as his wife during the Jokyu War , he was confined to the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and after the Jokyu War , he gained the trust of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and gained the real power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi ( liaison officer in the Kanto region ) and was raised to Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) .
The family name of Saion - ji Temple derives from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his second residence in Kyoto ( Kitayama no sho , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono , and the present Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA over this land .
He received the support of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) from Kintsune , and gained power over the Sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) through the Kamakura period .
Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) and gave his daughter to Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
However , after the death of his son , Kinhira SAIONJI , the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) came from the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , supporting the Jimyoin - to ( imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu ) and deepened the conflict with Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) .
Later , in the era of Kinmune SAIONJI , the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) fell and was dismissed from Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO ( Tokioki ) , who was the remnants of the Hojo clan , and assassinated Emperor Godaigo , who started the Kenmu Restoration , and planned a scheme to enthrone the Retired Emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin - to ( imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu ) , and therefore , Kinmune was arrested and executed due to the betrayal of his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI .
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Sanetoshi SAIONJI , the son of Kinmune SAIONJI , served the Northern Court ( Japan ) and became Udaijin ( Minister of the Right ) and restored the family name .
In the Muromachi period and the Edo period , it was also known as a family which specialized in biwa ( Japanese lute ) .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI invited Tadataka HOSOKAWA , the legitimate son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later disinherited ) , and his eldest daughter Tokuhime , who was the heir of Kyumu NAGAOKA , to serve as a Midaidokoro ( a wife of a shogun ) , but Nagaoka Kyumu NAGAOKA received various funds from the Saionji family and donated 600 stones to the Saionji family ( <unk> ) .
At the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from the Tokudaiji family of the same Kanin line , and after the Meiji Restoration , he was active as a politician and served as Prime Minister , and played an important role in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods as a Genro .
Incidentally , Kinmochi did not like playing biwa ( Japanese lute ) , which was supposed to be the family business of the Saionji family , but during his prime minister 's service , he was said to have wished to listen to the biwa ( Japanese lute ) of the Saionji family for a long time , and there is an anecdote that he was forced to play together with the staff of gagaku ( ancient Japanese court dance and music ) of the Imperial Household Ministry of the Imperial Household .

According to the postscript , it was established around 996 , when Sachujo ( Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards ) MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa brought it from the house of the author and spread to the public .
After that , the book was revised and it is considered that it was written around the end of the year of the Kanko era .
The text of " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) , which was drawn in " Genji Monogatari Shimeisho " ( The Tale of Genji ) of The Tale of Genji , does not exist in the text of " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) , and it seems to have a complicated process .

It is an Important Cultural Property .
It is said to be the oldest copy of " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) in the early Kamakura period .
Among them , the Gokogon - in Temple version of the <unk> line is included in " Gunsho ruiju"(Collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi HANAWA ) , and the three events of the <unk> are included in " Shin - Gunsho Ruiju " ( New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) .
Since the Noin version was used as the original text for old movable editions ( Kanei era ) in the early Edo period , it became a set of commentaries such as " Makura no soshi <unk> " ( The Pillow Book ) , " Makura no Soshi <unk> " ( The Pillow Book ) and " Makura no Soshi <unk> " ( Commentary on Kigin KITAMURA ) , which became a commentary on " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) and " Makura no Soshi <unk> " ( The Pillow Book ) .
However , after the World War II , Jutaro TANAKA ( 1917 - 1987 ) re - evaluated the second edition of the third volume , and after the Second World War , it was exclusively published and was read as a textbook .
In addition , the " Makura no Soshi Ekotoba " ( picture scroll of the Pillow Book ) , which was written in the late Kamakura period , is considered to have been used in the text of Kotobagaki ( captions ) , and the " Makura no Soshi Ekotoba " ( picture scroll of the Pillow Book ) , which was written in the late Kamakura period , still exists .
In addition , the second edition of the three - volume manuscript has an independent text of 300 chapters .

On the other hand , there is a vague chapter of classification ( for example , ' Spring Dawn Dawn ' has been opposed to <unk> chapters ) .
It is written in a simple colloquial style that uses hiragana ( Japanese syllabary characters ) , but in general , there are many short stories in general , and in contrast to the downfall of the Nakanokanpaku family and the misfortune of his lord Teishi , there is also a feeling of <unk> .
While the sophisticated sense of beauty of the author , and the sharp observation of the object of the " Tale of Genji " was fused with the expression of ' Mono no aware ' and the beauty of ' <unk> ' in " Genji Monogatari " ( The Tale of Genji ) , the expression of ' Mono no aware ' ( pathos of things ) , which was expressed in the feelings of " Genji Monogatari " ( The Tale of Genji ) .
<unk> evaluation
Because the Makura no soshi deeply loved human beings , nature , and nature , they had a variety of beauty and forms as well as a wide variety of beauty ( <unk> ) .
In accordance with the <unk> of the following chapters , there are no differences in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are repeated from the following .
The expression of ' <unk> ' ( the season ) is a novel written in the ' Spring - Hana - Hana ' ( Spring ) , which is seen in the Kokin Wakashu ( Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) , which is seen in the ' Spring - Hana - Hana - <unk> ' ( Spring and Autumn ) , in which the word ' <unk> ' ( literally , ' Spring ' ) was written in the form of ' <unk> ' ( literally , ' <unk> ' ) , which was a way of the beauty of readers who were accustomed to the traditional Japanese poetry .
She showed great respect to chugu Teishi .
It was written in order to console Teishi 's soul , who died after the death of Teishi , when the Michitaka family declined .
Therefore , it is natural to say that the decline of the Michitaka family was not written ( same as the above - mentioned above ) .
Even in the period of despair , even when people surrounding chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) and chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) were in despair , they also claimed that they lived in the world of Yoshihisa ( Ueno no ri [ law of Kozuke Province ] ) .

It appears in the <unk> style ( <unk> AKIYAMA ) that tried to forget the class from Sei Shonagon to assimilate into the upper reaches of the school .
( This is because it does not have any honorific title for those who have high social status than their relatives . )
It was just ' the record of the civilization of the empress 's residence ' and was not written by the qualification of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ISHIDA ) .
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( also known as Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) was the 15th seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ( his reign was from January 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 ) .
He was the only shogun who did not work as Shogun in Edo - jo Castle .
He was awarded the rank of Junior First Rank , First Order of Merit .
He was a member of the House of Peers .
He became the 15th shogun of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) after the death of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the 14th shogun who had acted as a guardian .
After the Emperor Meiji returned to power ( Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he tried to unite the imperial court and the shogunate , but in the Battle of Toba and Fushimi after the Restoration of Imperial Rule ( Japan ) , he returned from Osaka - jo Castle to Edo - jo Castle , leaving the former Shogunate army , and received an order to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court , and surrendered the Edo - jo Castle .
After he was removed from house arrest in the Meiji period , he devoted himself to hobbies and lived as a prince until the Taisho period .
Yoshinobu ' is also read as ' <unk> ' or ' <unk> ' as his common name .
In the official documents of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , there is a record that " <unk> " was read as " <unk> . "
His name was written as ' <unk> ' in the English language and English newspaper by himself .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' <unk> , ' but in Shizuoka City , where he spent the rest of his life , he is often called ' <unk> . '
According to the person who knew Yoshinobu while he was alive , Yoshinobu himself liked to be called ' <unk> sama ' and he also called himself ' <unk> ' to his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
It is said that Yoshinobu , who succeeded Yoshinobu , was also called ' <unk> ' by people around him as well as Yoshinobu .
It is considered that there are two ways of calling them ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> san ' ( <unk> ) , and it is quite rare today , but the word ' <unk> san ' can be found not only in Shizuoka but also in various places , and the word ' <unk> san ' ( <unk> ) is often used in both cases .
Ryotaro SHIBA said that ' many people called " <unk> " were related to the former retainers of the shogun , but it is possible that he was highly respected in a wide range of areas because of the fact that the use of the people related to the Higo Domain , who worked for the overthrow of the Shogunate , could be confirmed . '
On September 29 , 1837 , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was the shogun who gave birth to his lawful wife , Princess Yoshiko ( the third Shogun , Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) .
However , Iemitsu 's real mother is considered to be the lawful wife of his father Hidetada , but there is also a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was <unk> .
He moved to Mito Domain seven months after Nariaki 's education policy called ' raising his son in his hometown , ' and spent many days until he inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and he was taught about learning and martial arts from <unk> and others .
Yoshinobu 's <unk> seemed to have received attention from those days , so Nariaki was not adopted by other families , and at first , he thought that he would be kept in hand as a seat for his eldest son Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ordered him to appoint <unk> to Mito Domain as a successor of the Hitotsubashi family .
After this , Shichiro succeeded to the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December , he took the name of Yoshinobu from Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA , the 12th shogun .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi - tei residence , so he thought Yoshinobu as a leading candidate for the heir of the shogun , but he gave up the offer of roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) Masahiro ABE .
In 1853 , the shogun Ieyoshi died of illness in the midst of the disorder of the arrival of the Black Ships , and Iesada TOKUGAWA , the 13th shogun , who succeeded Ieyoshi , had no chance to have a son and had a son , therefore , there was a problem that ' the heir to the shogun ' ( the heir of the shogun ) was born ( the issue of the heir ) .
The Hitotsubashi group , including Nariaki , Masahiro ABE , and Nariakira SHIMAZU , the lord of the Satsuma Domain , and Naosuke II , the lord of the Hikone Domain , who recommended Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA , the lord of the Kishu Domain , and Honjuin , the real mother of Iesada , opposed the Nanki group .
The Hitotsubashi group tried to make Tenshoin , the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , to become Shogun and Midaidokoro ( shogun 's wife ) , but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another and the Tairo ( chief minister ) Naosuke II , who became the Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 , decided to ' Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA . '
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States .
Yoshinobu went to the castle with Nariaki , Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of Fukui Domain , and others and questioned Naosuke , but on the contrary , he was accused of the crime of visiting the castle , and in 1859 , he retired ( Ansei no Taigoku [ suppression of extremists by the Shogunate ] ) .
On the other hand , Yoshinobu himself sent Nariaki a letter to Nariaki that says , ' I do not want to make me an heir of the shogun , but I would not want to take advantage of the whole country because of failure . '
In 1860 , he was suspended from house arrest .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy Shigetomi OHARA , who was guarded by the soldiers of the Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , went to Edo and received an imperial order from the Emperor Komei to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as the guardian of the shogun , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga ) to Tairo .
On August 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as Shogun 's guardian and Shungaku as the president of the political affairs .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku implemented the reformation of the shogunate government , which was called Bunkyu Reforms , and established Kyoto shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) , <unk> of Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) and so on .
In 1863 , he went up to Kyoto as a pioneer of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , who was the shogun , to negotiate with the Imperial Court , which urged the expulsion of foreigners .
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , Iemochi received a sword from the Emperor and had to carry out Joi ( expulsion of foreigners ) , so he called himself ' <unk> ' ( a cold fever ) and forced Iemochi to stop his audience with Iemochi .
After the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians ) led by the Choshu Domain was expelled in the Coup of August 18 , he returned to Kyoto to participate in the Council of Sanyo ( Councilor ) by the Kobu Gattai ( integration of the shogunate and the shogunate ) and the Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Shogun ) .
However , if the conference could not be concluded , he got drunk at a drinking party with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko , and <unk> DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , who were together together with Imperial Prince Asahiko and others , and furthermore , he also tried to <unk> him , saying , ' We would have received any money from Shimazu . '
After that , he stayed in Kyoto and was appointed as the Governor - General of the Imperial Palace , and together with Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Aizu Domain ) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Kuwana Domain ) , the governor of the Aizu Domain ) , and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Kuwana Domain ) , and the Imperial Court , together with the Imperial loyalists and the court nobles ( <unk> ( the Aizu Domain , Aizu Domain , Kuwana Domain , Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA and other vassals of the Mito Domain including Kounsai TAKEDA , who supported Yoshinobu , were <unk> .
In 1864 , in the Kinmon Incident , he commanded the army of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and attacked the Choshu army , which occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of the Choshu Domain ended , he worked hard for the imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States , which had been an imperial sanction , and succeeded in obtaining an Imperial sanction on condition .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an Imperial order to subjugate Choshu .
However , the Satsuma Domain refused to send troops to the Satsuma Domain , which formed the Satsuma - Choshu Alliance , and the bakufu army was defeated .
On August 20 , in the midst of the Second Conquest of Choshu , Shogun Iemochi died at Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu made a campaign to the Imperial Court and raised an Imperial edict to cease - fire , and succeeded in concluding a cease - fire agreement .
Although Iemochi was recommended to succeed Iemochi , Yoshinobu firmly declined it .
On September 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family succeeded to the position of shogun , but he continued to refuse .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) and others requested him to become shogun , but they did not accept it , and on January 5 , they were given the title of Shogun by the Emperor Komei and became shogun .
In other words , it was intended to promote the government by selling the favor of the shogun by selling the favor of the shogun .
Yoshinobu established Yokosuka Iron Factory , Construction Construction , and <unk> <unk> with the help of <unk> dollars from France through French minister LÃ©on LÃ©on LÃ©on <unk> , and invited military advisers including Jules Brunet to reform the military system .
Also , his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was sent to the Paris World Exposition , and encouraged the students of the shogun 's retainers to study in Europe .
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port , he insisted on the Imperial Court and received an imperial sanction .
On October 14 , 1867 , Yoshinobu , who was forced to go down to Satsuma and Choshu , reported to the Imperial Court that he would return to the government ( Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) ) .
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time judged that there was no administrative ability , and tried to continue the Tokugawa government in the form of a council of feudal lords .
However , due to the plan of Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA , who were aiming to overthrow the Shogunate , the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December , and Yoshinobu was ordered to ' Jikan nochi ' ( the Minister of the Interior and the Tokugawa 's territory ) ( dedicated to the Minister of the Interior and the Tokugawa family ) .
Yoshinobu left the Osaka - jo Castle in order to avoid a conflict , and gathered foreign ministers and others of foreign countries and insisted on the legitimacy of the Tokugawa shogunate , and furthermore , the Imperial Court requested the Imperial Court to change Jikan - nochi into a gentle form .
However , in the following year , 1868 , the Satsuma Domain raised an army by provoked the Satsuma Domain in Edo and blocked Kyoto with the soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana Domains .
However , in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , which broke out on January 3 , when the former Shogunate army was in a disadvantageous situation , and even though they still maintained enough military strength , they left behind soldiers and retreated to Edo with " Gunkan " ( military exploits of the bakufu ) .
Soon after that , the Imperial army led by Yoshinobu to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu as an enemy of the Emperor , and the government army led by Prince Arisugawa - no - kami ( Captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards ) and Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started to advance to the east .
Yoshinobu insisted on obedience to the resistance party including Tadaosa OGURI and others .
In February , he entrusted Kaishu KATSU to settle the situation , and he himself confined himself to the Daiji - in Temple of Ueno Kanei - ji Temple .
The head of the Tokugawa family was transferred to his adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU ( later Iesato TOKUGAWA ) .

On the same day , he received Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flower .
As for studying martial arts and learning , he grew up in the highest environment , and was enthusiastic about shuriken from various martial arts , and was a master of shuriken .
Even after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he practiced shuriken in his forehead and was counted as the most famous person among the masters of shuriken .
It seems that when his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , went to sleep in order to make a problem when his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA succeeded to the Tokugawa family , he had a <unk> ( <unk> ) in order to <unk> the <unk> of the Tokugawa family , and when he was just a mistake , it was just a mistake that he would not be injured , and when he was sleeping , it would not be removed ) .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote in which when he came of age , he went to sleep with three wives and concubines as a measure to assassinate him .
Although Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph of his childhood , it is questionable whether Yoshinobu himself was actually a picture of Yoshinobu himself .
It is said that he visited Iemochi , who fell ill , to ask him to visit him , and at that time , he had a common conversation .
Tatewaki AJIMA , the biological father of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , was known for his <unk> and commented on Yoshinobu as ' <unk> the flow of the Tokugawa family , ' and when he took the expectations of his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , he was able to become the Shogun , ' he was praised by him as ' the second coming of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA . '
Hideaki of Yoshinobu was also well known for the anti - shogunate faction , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu Domain , especially Takayoshi KIDO , who was a member of the Choshu clan , did not have a good relationship with Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI .
He was wary of Ieyasu 's coming of life . '
In response to the decision of Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , Ryoma SAKAMOTO said , " It is a great person ( shogun ) , and this is the present - day act . "
It is also possible to say that he would be able to deal with the situation .
He praised Yoshinobu as ' I am alive for my loyalty , ' and tried to give Yoshinobu the position of vice chief chancellor of the new government to him .
However , it was in the Meiji period that Yoshinobu knew the existence of Ryoma 's personality ( after Ryoma 's death ) .
It was not limited to Yoshinobu , and Ryoma 's reputation was very low than that after the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi and ran back to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy 's side by saying ' The enemy of the enemy . '
At that time , the <unk> - umajirushi , which had been worn by Ieyasu , was forgotten , but some of them did not forget his favorite favorite concubine , so some <unk> Yoshinobu 's favorite concubine , who had been accompanied by him .
However , there is also an opinion that it was necessary to resist armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Province , because Yoshinobu had become an enemy of the Emperor 's enemy , and there was a conflict between feudal lords and other feudal lords , and even if he was able to guard Osaka - jo Castle , there was no way to prevent foreign intervention .
On the other hand , he was regarded as a person who valued the Emperor and the Imperial Court because he was considered as an enemy of the Emperor , or because he was confined to Kanei - ji Temple , but it is considered that he had a great influence on Mitogaku ( the scholarship and academic traditions of Mito ) , which was thought to have been a thought of reverence for the Emperor , and his mother was from the Imperial Family ) , and on the other hand , it was also said that he did not have a sense of weakness as a lord .
Due to the bloodless surrender of Edo - jo Castle and the bloodless surrender of the Edo - jo Castle , the independence of modern Japan was protected and it was highly evaluated as a great contribution to the Meiji Restoration .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed as the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and had a friendly relationship with him even after the Meiji Restoration .
SHIBUSAWA , in the later years of Yoshinobu 's life , tried to compile Yoshinobu 's biography , and persuaded Yoshinobu to persuade him , and opened the ' <unk> - kai ' ( <unk> - kai ) .
The " <unk> <unk> " was compiled .
According to a part of the book , it can be said that Yoshinobu , who was old , can be seen .
As a result of this , he was asked to ask for a good reason , and when Hisamitsu SHIMAZU did not like Hisamitsu , ' Naomasa NABESHIMA , ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a <unk> person , ' he showed his feelings and feelings of him .
Based on these materials , " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA 's official introduction " was completed after Yoshinobu 's death .
In order to show his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji , who gave the title of duke , who was the highest rank of the nobility , he pardoned him as an enemy of the Emperor , and presented his funeral to him instead of a Shinto funeral .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was built not only in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family of the Zojo - ji Temple , which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family , but also in Yanaka Cemetery , there was a round barrow similar to that of the Imperial Family .
This was because the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was impressed by the fact that the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was modest ( " Tokugawa Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA <unk> " ) .
After he was pardoned , Yoshinobu spent his life in a quiet life without thinking of the former Shogun 's retainers who had dedicated his life to him , so Katsukiyo ITAKURA , a roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) at that time , regretted that ' Yoshinobu acted together with Yoshinobu . '
Although he had an image of <unk> in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , he started to establish a new modern political system after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and in recent years , there was also a movement to re - evaluate Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Historical drama ) as well as Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK ) .
The pork of the Satsuma Domain like his father Nariaki was fond of the Satsuma Domain , and it was called " Hitotsubashi - sama , " which liked pork and pork .
In addition , in his later years , he was interested in Western culture such as bread and milk , and he was interested in his hobbies such as photographs , photographs by camera , fishing , bicycle , <unk> , and handicraft ( embroidery ) , and he also learned French from Amane NISHI ( illuminator ) , however , it seems that he failed .
Although he was famous as a camera , he seems to have never improved the camera skills .
It is said that he frequently contributed to the photo magazines , but it was not adopted for a long time .
His great - grandson , <unk> TOKUGAWA , was also a free - free camera , and his photographs were found in the hands of the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family , including Yoshinobu 's filming , and it was published in the process of editing and editing .
His younger brother , Akitake TOKUGAWA , was a friend of his hobbies .
She married Mikako ICHIJO on December 3 , 1856 ( changed her name to Mikako after the Meiji Restoration ) .

Note
Nara <unk> is a railway line ( main line ) of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) , which runs from Kizu Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) to Kyoto Station in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
The entire line is included in the metropolitan area .
Because the history of the Kansai Main Line has been established as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , the formal starting station is Kizu Station , but the trains that go from Kyoto Station to Kizu Station ( the number number of trains is odd ) , and the inbound trains ( even in the same number ) are provided .
If the following data are specified , it will be described in the direction of Kizu from Kyoto to Kizu .
The color of the line is brown ( <unk> ) , and the reason for selecting is said to have been ' an image of Classic of Ancient Capital connecting two ancient capitals . '
Jurisdiction ( business type ): West Japan Railway Company ( railway operator )
Railway distance ( operating kilometers ): <unk> km
Track gauge : 1067 mm
Number of stations : 19 ( including the starting and last stations )
Double - tracked section : Shinden - Uji section , JR Fujinomori - Kyoto section
Electrified section : entire line electrified ( DC1500V )
Block system ( railway ) : automatic block system ( double - track section ) , single - track automatic block system ( single track section )
Safety device : Automatic Train Stop device
Operation Center : Shin - Osaka General Control Center
Maximum speed : 110 km / h ( double track section ) , 95 km / h ( single track section )
Except for Kizu Station , Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) Kyoto Branch ( Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company ) .
Although the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line , the entire line is located in Kyoto Prefecture and there is no route in Nara Prefecture .
This was originally constructed by the Nara Railway , but was separated from the Kizu - south section as a part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the merger of the Kansai Railway Company .
However , the trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station in Nara Prefecture by entering the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) .
After the revision of March 13 , 1988 , the JR West established a nickname for each line of the Urban Network ( such as the JR Kyoto Line and the JR Kobe Line ) , but the Nara Line was sent to the Nara Line .
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is also located on the Kintetsu Nara Line , it is sometimes referred to as the ' JR Nara Line . '
In the era of Japan National Railways , it was described as ' the Nara Line of Japan National Railways ' and the English notation of the guide board was also used .
The Kintetsu Nara Line is related to the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line .
While many trains of the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line were operated in parallel with the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 at the end of Japan National Railways , and even after the electrification , it was only a small local line that ran on the JNR Series 105 cars .
However , after the inauguration of JR West , four - car trains ( six - car trains ) were incorporated into the Urban Network , a double - track section , a double - track double - track section , and the number of rapid trains , including ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and so on , were rapidly improved .
At present , it has a strong character as a commuter and school route from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture , such as Uji City , and Joyo City , which are along the line .
However , the section between Momoyama and Shinden , which runs on the east side of the line , has a gap between the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and the areas that run in parallel with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , which runs in parallel with the central part of the town .
The trains are used by the Nara Train Yard of the Osaka branch , but the station facilities are managed by the Kyoto branch , except for Kizu Station .
At all stations , J - Through , ICOCA , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , and PiTaPa of Surutto KANSAI can be used .
Due to the fact that the station is unmanned in the south of Joyo Station , it becomes a simplified ticket .
Since the Express ' Kuroshio ' , which had been connected by the Nara Line , Sakurai Line , and Wakayama Line in 1984 , was abolished , only local trains were operated by local trains until 1991 ( as for limited express trains , special express trains were operated temporarily for a certain period ) , and four types of rapid trains and local trains are currently operated .
It is the most rapid type of the Nara Line and is operated mainly in the daytime .
Basically , the train makes a connection with a local train at Uji Station with a local train at the intervals of 30 minutes .
The nickname ' Miyako Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was decided by the general public before the start of the operation .
It is often used as a train connecting Kyoto and Nara , not only by Japanese people but also by tourists .
All the trains are operated by the JR West Series 221 and are operated with four cars or six cars .
In the double - track section , the maximum speed is 110 km / h , and other trains are 95 km / h .
The standard required time is about 44 minutes away from Kyoto , and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Kyoto .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station for two minutes , and therefore , the inbound and outbound trains go to Nara Station , and the required time is slightly different from the Miyakoji Rapid Service .
During the three - three days of the new year , the Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari - inari Station .
History
March 3 , 2001 : The operation started .
March 15 , 2003 : Due to the timetable revision , it began to stop at Tofuku - ji Station and Tamamizu Station .
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours .
It also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) , where the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' runs .
All the 221 series are operated with four cars or six cars .
Basically , the train makes a connection with a local train at Uji Station with a local train at the intervals of 30 minutes .
In the same way as the Miyakoji Rapid Service of the Yamatoji Line , the Yamatoji Line stopped at Narayama Station .
Until March 2001 , when the ' Miyako <unk> Rapid Service ' appeared , the trains of the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 were used for the trains of Kyoto , Uji , Joyo ( initially passed ) , Kizu and Nara , but since then , they were not used on the Nara Line .
In the morning and evening , there are some trains that run directly to the Yamatoji Line due to the convenience of the operation .
It is operated mainly in the morning and at night .
At first , the timetable was revised on March 18 , 2006 , but the timetable came to be operated on Saturdays and holidays .
Although the trains stop at every station between Uji Station and Nara Station , in the past , there was a regional rapid train heading for Uji Station in order to drive down local trains at Uji Station during the late night , but now , the local trains running in the section were changed to the final station .
One train departing from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays uses the JNR 103 series Series 103 , and all trains are operated with the 221 series .
During the morning rush hours , trains run directly from the Yamatoji Line for the convenience of the operation .
The Nara Line used the same color as the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and the same orange color as the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' to prevent the <unk> of the Yamatoji Line , but due to the timetable revision made in March 2008 , the timetable was revised , the operation of the regional rapid trains came to be used as a green line , and the line of the regional rapid train was not used instead of the line .
In the timetable of the station on the north of Kamikoma Station , it is written in purple letters .
It is operated between Kyoto and Uji , Joyo , and Nara .
During the daytime , the section between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station is operated at a 15 - minute interval , but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station becomes a 30 - minute interval .
Basically , the cars are operated on the 103 series , but they are operated with some 221 series .
There are some trains that run directly to the Yamatoji Line during the early morning and late at night .
In the past , there were some direct trains with the Sakurai Line , but the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines due to the timetable revision on September 4 , 1994 .
Although it was a special train , limited express trains were also operated on the Nara Line .
From 1987 to 1988 , the ' Kuroshio ' was used for the nickname of the JNR / JR Limited Express / JR Limited Express 381 electric train , and the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line , the Hanwa Line , and the Hanwa Line were operated via the Hanwa Line and Hanwa Line .
In the Kinki edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun on January 6 , 1998 , there was a report that a limited express train would run on the Nara Line ( as a regular train ) in 2001 , but the plan was cancelled .
It was once operated between Kyoto and Sakurai ( between Kyoto and Nara ) as the Miyako Leisure Line , but the direct trains were n't operated on the Sakurai Line including temporary trains .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Festival , which is the nearest train to Uji Station , is held , but it is operated during special schedule from 16 to 16:00 , and all local trains run between Kyoto Station and Uji Station for 10 minutes .
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station .
At the time of the first three days of the new year , the special timetable was made completely , and the rapid trains stopped at every station between Kyoto Station and Uji Station , and the number of trains was increased to increase the number of trains .
Depending on the year , some trains were set up on the shuttle trains returning to Momoyama Station .
Around 1992 , the direct train to the Sakurai Line was extended to Tenri Station , mainly on Saturdays and holidays , and the special rapid train was operated for one hour .
In addition , special trains are sometimes available from all over Japan .
In particular , during the Tenri <unk> Festival on October 26 every year , the trains called ' exclusive train bound for the group ' run from Kyoto Station to Tenri Station via the Nara Line , the Nara Line , and the Yamatoji Line , and the Sakurai Line .
All of them belong to the Nara Train Depot .
JR West Suburban Train Series 221
They are commonly used on the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line , and there are two - car trains , four - car trains and six - car trains .
It is mainly used for four - car trains and six - car trains in the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and ' Rapid Service , ' but four - car trains run on the Nara Line .
Two - car trains and two - car trains are used for holidays .
JNR / JR Commuter Train Series 103
The 103 series Series 103 , which is used for local trains on the Nara Line , is used only for the operation of the Nara Line , and it is also used as a rapid train on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during rush hour .
Some of the cars were transferred from Morinomiya Train Depot on the Osaka Loop Line .

Also , along the National Route 24 between JR - JR - Fujinomori Station and Momoyama Station , the Keihan Uji Line , which runs between Kohata Station and Uji Station ( near Obaku Station ) , are located in a difficult section .
Because of the shortage of budget , it is possible that the Sagano Line ( between the Sanin Main Line and Sonobe Station ) would be further promoted even at least , and after the entire line came into operation , the entire line was double - tracked .
In the Kinki Regional Transport Council , the plan to direct the line with the Tokaido Main Line ( JR Kyoto Line ) was reviewed in the future ( it was also planned that the train would run every night from the late New Year 's Eve to the early morning of New Year 's Eve ) .

Keiji Bypass ( <unk> ) is a bypass of general National Highway Road that runs from Kusatsu City , Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama - cho , Kuse - gun , Kyoto Prefecture .
It was designated as a local standard project .
The Keiji Bypass , a toll road , explains the Keiji Bypass as follows : The Keiji Bypass of National Highway 1 and the National Highway Route No . 24 will be described as follows :
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway and connects with the Otsu City and Kyoto City area , and connects with the Ritto Interchange , Nagoya City , Suita Interchange , and Osaka City area .
According to the law , the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange are National Route 1 and 478 , and the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange ( Keiji Bypass ) , the Kumiyama Interchange - Yodo Junction - the Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama - sen Junction - the National Highway Highway Road ( National Highway Road exclusive for National Highway Highway Treasures ) , and the Kumiyama - Yodo Junction ( Kyoto Jukan Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) , the Kumiyama Expressway ( Kyoto Jukan Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) , and the Kumiyama Expressway ( Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) are designated as the National Highway Highway II .
In the later project , the Kyoto Daini Daini - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - doro were built .
The Kyoto Jukan Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway are designated as National Route 478 and have consistently been maintained .
According to the indication of the route , the Keiji Bypass is considered to be the Keiji Bypass in Seta Junction - Oyamazaki Junction , which is easier to understand by users .
In addition , even if the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass pass pass through either of them , the fare fee and the ETC discount system are not different .
If otherwise specified , the Keiji Bypass ( from the Seta Interchange to the Oyamazaki Junction ) , which is a commercial name , will be explained .

Oyamazaki Interchange / JCT - Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange
The Uji Tunnel of this route is the longest tunnel among the National Route 1 , and the tunnel is forbidden to change the lane except for the Uji - higashi Interchange and the Kasatori Interchange .
Prior to the opening of the Kumiyama Junction , the film " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " was shot in front of the Kumiyama Junction .
Seta - higashi Interchange - The distance of Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT is slightly shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and if the Keiji Bypass runs at the highest speed , it is more accessible to the destination via Keiji Bypass .
Since there are no rest space in the service area , it is often crowded with Meishin Expressway ( there are two locations in the Otsu Service Area and the Katsura Parking Area ) .
However , the structure of both Seta Higashi - Seta and Oyamazaki Junction was established using the <unk> of the Meishin Expressway ( especially the structure of Oyamazaki Junction became extremely complicated ) , which led to the decrease in the <unk> ( high - speed road ) .
In the case of the transfer from Oyamazaki Junction to Suita Junction and Osaka area , there is a fault that if the Meishin Expressway is merged with the Meishin Expressway and the left route of the Meishin Expressway , there is an obstacle to traffic .
In addition , since there are many drivers who want to avoid such curves and slopes on the way , they do not function sufficiently as a bypass of Meishin Expressway .
This road is a bypass of National Highway 1 ( National Highway ) , and it is an exclusive highway for automobiles and is not a highway .
If you pass the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka on the east side of the Uji - gawa River , you must go to the Uji - nishi Interchange .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is half - IC .
For this reason , the section between the Uji - higashi Interchange and the Uji - nishi Interchange is often congested .
Because this general road section is not connected to the <unk> , it is difficult to avoid traffic congestion .

Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is a god ( humanized god ) appearing in Japanese Mythology .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' is referred to as ' <unk> . '
It is a god who deified the sun and is considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial Family .
In " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is described as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
It is also called <unk> no Kami or <unk> no Kami .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , several gods were described , while " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) states that ' Amaterasu Omikami ' was unified in the shinmei ( name of a god ) .
Although she is a goddess , there is also a different opinion that she was a male god .
As the shinmei ( name of god ) of Amaterasu Omikami was used in political parts such as " Kotai Kotai - jingu <unk> " ( the list of Kotai Kotai - jingu Shrine ) , there is a theory that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no Mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Imperial Family , and that <unk> became Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
In Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , or Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , or Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) at the time of rites and festivals , and it is also called Amaterasu Omikami Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
In an academic document , ' Amaterasu ' and ' <unk> ' have become a practice .
There is a theory that it was written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) in ancient times .
Description in mythology
According to " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , when Izanagi returned from the Yominokuni ( the land of the dead ) where Izanami lived , she was born when she washed her left eye .
At that time , he was called Mihashira no uzuno miko ( three children ) along with Tsukuyomi , who was born from the right eye , and Susano who was born from his nose .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to govern Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susanoo , who was entrusted with the ocean , cried in tears , saying that he wanted to go to Nenokuni ( the land of the Roots ) where Izanami was , so he was expelled by Izanagi .
Susanoo went to Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) to meet his older sister Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) before he went to Nenokuni , but Amaterasu Omikami thought that his younger brother came from Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and waited for him .
In order to prove Susano 's innocence , Susano made a pledge to prove Susano 's innocence , and a five - god god god god from Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Susano 's real god , and Susano 's three female gods were born from Susano , and Susano declared his victory .
The following five gods were born from the fact of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and the children of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
<unk> ( <unk> )
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo , who was pleased with this , made a violent act in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amaterasu Omikami hid in Ama no iwato ( Cave of heaven ) .
The world became in the darkness and various misfortunes occurred .
( Yaoyorozu no mikoto , such as <unk> no Mikoto , the god of wisdom , and <unk> no mikoto , succeeded in producing Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) from Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and Susano was expelled from Takamanohara ( the Plain of High Heaven ) .
He descended to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( Literally , " Central Land of Reed Plains " ) to pray for Amenooshihomimi 's son , and sent Amatsu kami ( heavenly god ) .
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni was subdued , Amenooshihomimi finally came to earth , but Ninigi was born and made Ninigi 's grandson Ninigi descended to earth .
<unk> interpretation
In the mythology , there is a scene in which Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) prayed to the god of heaven ( Takamimusubi ) who was born earlier than him and followed him , and therefore , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is considered to have been deified as the Emperor who ruled the country by performing religious services ( religious services ) .
In addition , there is also a view that she was deified as a shrine maiden in ancient times .
The other name ' <unk> ' is ' Hi no onna ' ( a woman of the sun ) and is a shrine maiden serving the sun god .
Although the sun god was originally a male god , there is a theory that a shrine maiden who served it was equated with the sun god and became a goddess .
Also , there is a theory that this goddess was established around the time of Empress Jito , who was an empress , or that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
The birth of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and the sun of Tsukuyomi is pointed out to have a strong influence on Dokyo that ' the sun of the sun and the moon is the sun of the sun ' ( before the sixth century ) , ' the sun of the sun and the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun , the sun of the sun of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and the moon of the moon ' ( from the beginning of the seventh century to the beginning of the seventh century ) , and the influence of Dokyo has been pointed out .
It is also said that the terms such as Okami ( great god ) of Ise - jingu Shrine that enshrines Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , jingu Shrine , Saigu ( Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise - jingu Shrine ) , <unk> no Miya ( <unk> no miya ) , Murasaki no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Toyouke no Okami are combined with Taoism .
In comparison , it is pointed out that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and others correspond to the <unk> myth , which has been recorded in the older period ( three to fourth centuries ) .
In addition , there is a theory that it was a universal <unk> which spread throughout Asia , so it is a myth that spread to Japan along with people in the prehistoric times .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the divinity changed into three stages .
The following is a summary of the incident and the contents of the incident , which is the turning point .
645 : Taika Reforms
The Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami before this time .
The word ' <unk> ' refers to the sun .
A male god named ' <unk> ' was enshrined widely .
In " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines that read ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' such as ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima , ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Harima Province and ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Tanba .
Incidentally , <unk> is another name for Amenohoakari , a grandson of Amaterasu , and Amenohoakari is also the founder of the Owari clan , Tsumori clan , and Amabe clan .
The younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi and was a great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : The Jinshin War .
It is also called ' <unk> no <unk> ' or ' <unk> no <unk> ' or ' <unk> no <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In this case , there is an interpretation that the enshrined deity is <unk> no <unk> no <unk> , and it is interpreted as ' <unk> ' of male gods .
698 : Founded by Kotai - jingu Shrine .
Amaterasu ' and ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family . '
She is a goddess .
It was created by the nature god as a model for Empress Jito .
After that , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) other than the Imperial Family was called ' <unk> ' ( the Sun Goddess ) .
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( around 1060 ) , the part of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' is read as ' <unk> ' and also in ' <unk> ' of " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
1880 - 1881 , over the enshrined deity of Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto Jimukyoku ) in Hibiya , Tokyo , a religious dispute arose in the Shinto religion .
The Shinto Jimukyoku decided to enshrine the four gods of creation ( Ame no Minakanushi no Kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Kamimusubi no kami ) and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) as the enshrined deity in the shrine of the clerical bureau , but ' Izumo - ha ' ( the Izumo school ) insisted that the enshrined deity should be enshrined as ' <unk> ' ( the same as the other world ) and ' <unk> ' ( the realm of the world and the world ) , and the five deities ( the other world ) should be controlled by Okuninushi ( god of Izumo ) .
However , the ' Ise - ha ' , which played the central role of the Shinto Jimukyoku , was ' the supreme leader of the heaven and earth ' that Amaterasu Omikami ruled Ryokai Ryokai ( the Two Realms Realms ) , and the other gods insisted that they were too loyal to them , and the both sides opposed each other .
As a result , there were various rumors , such as ' The Izumo school of the Izumo - ha ( Izumo school of Buddhism ) has a long time since the age of gods ' and ' the <unk> of the House of Sen , who has a <unk> heart in the Imperial Family , shall be killed . '
Later , this dispute was settled by the decision of Emperor Meiji ( the Izumo school was defeated ) , and the divinity of Amaterasu Omikami was ranked at the highest rank .
It is said that the government recognized the possibility of creation of the creed system common to Shinto , and that the modern nation recognized the possibility that it would directly control the people directly through the restoration Shinto teachings .
Refer to a dispute over the enshrined deity of State Shinto Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto Jimukyoku ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA used " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , another name of " <unk> " ( <unk> ) in his own novel .
This is because the name ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) came to appear in the following sentences , so the god of the Sun and the god of nature also had to use ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In fact , in the novel of Akutagawa , there were many cases in which he could not correct , corrections , corrections , corrections , and corrections by the command of the army .
<unk> YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who founded <unk> Gakuin in 1926 , said ' Japan has faith in Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amaterasu Omikami is an ideal to <unk> the world of Japanese spirit .
The ideal of Izanami and Izanagi 's ' <unk> ' is that it is a pioneer of the world , a pioneer , and a pioneer of the world . '

In the Muromachi period , shugo strengthened their control over their territories and became shugo daimyo ( provincial military governor ) .
In the Sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , a high - ranking feudal lord who established strong control over his own territory appeared and was called Kokujin ( local samurai ) and Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period ) .
In the Edo period , it came to refer to samurai families that were given more than 10,000 koku ( approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield ) by the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
Among the samurai who were less than 10,000 koku , samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called direct retainers .

This section explains the details of the early - modern daimyo in the Edo period .
For the details of Shugo daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) and Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) , refer to this article .
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) in the Edo period
Daimyo in the Edo period were determined by their social standing , official ranks , ranks , positions , and shikoseki ( anteroom seats for feudal lords ) .
First , due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family , it was classified into Fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) , which had been a vassal of the Tokugawa family ( shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , and Tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) , which had been a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara .
Ieyasu , the first shogun , established the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was permitted to use the family name of the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was permitted to use the Tokugawa family as well as to assist the shogun family , and appointed Yorinobu TOKUGAWA , the ninth son , to the Owari Domain , the 10th son of Yorinobu TOKUGAWA , and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA , the eleventh son of the Kishu Domain , and the Mito Domain .
In addition , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of Ieyasu and the second son of Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to Echizen Domain , and established a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) of the Tokugawa family throughout the country .
In addition , he placed fudai daimyo ( a hereditary vassal ) who had built the beginning of the Tokugawa Shogun family as fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu as a fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) , and also , in order to secure the bakufu 's military power , he was appointed as an important post centered on roju ( senior councilor ) of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , including Tairo ( chief minister ) of the bakufu ( a shogun ) , as well as to support the shogunate government .
The fudai daimyo were relatively low , and in addition , the Torii clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , the Ogasawara clan , and the Ogasawara clan were relatively <unk> , but the fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who maintained more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period such as the Sakai clan , the Hotta clan , the HOTTA clan , the Yanagisawa clan , and the Toda clan .
This led to the separation of power and military power .
After the Battle of Sekigahara , tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) were subordinated to the Tokugawa family , and many families were opposed to the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara .
In addition , the bakufu was strongly wary of the bakufu and actively engaged in intelligence activities by spy , and if there were fear of illegal activities and rebellion , they were severely punished by being deprived of their fief .
As a representative of tozama daimyo , the Kaga Domain of the Maeda clan , which had been famous as one thousand koku of Kaga Province , the Sendai Domain of the Shimazu clan since the Kamakura period , the Fukuoka Domain of the Kuroda clan , the Fukuoka Domain of the Kuroda clan , the Hiroshima Domain of the Asano clan , the Choshu clan of the Mori clan , the Choshu clan of the Mori clan , the Yonezawa clan of the Mori clan , the Yonezawa Domain , the Nabeshima clan of the Saga Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , and the Satake clan of the Okayama Domain , and the Satake clan of the Okayama Domain , etc .
In addition , when daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) stayed in Edo - jo Castle in Edo - jo Castle , a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) who had a territory equivalent to a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) or a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) was differentiated from a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) who had a castle with a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) and jinya ( regional government office ) , and the daimyo ( feudal lord ) who did not have a castle as a jinya ( regional government office ) was appointed to Edo - jo Castle , were also divided into a room .
For more information , refer to " shikoseki . "
In spite of the level of daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) , the daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) with 100,000 koku were not allowed to possess a total of 100,000 koku , and most of them had territories around the castle town and spots .
In extreme cases , one village was divided into another feudal lord ( <unk> ) .
Daimyo were generally more than 10,000 koku , but the Kitsuregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was 5,000 koku of the Kitsuregawa clan .
This is because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan .
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of Buke Shohatto ( Laws for the Military Houses ) and Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In addition , they were also ordered to defend the seashore at the end of the Edo period , and daimyo were always in financial difficulties .
