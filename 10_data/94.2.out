He is generally called Dogen Zenji .
It is said that he spread the manners and cleaning manners and cleaning manners in Japan .
There is also a theory that he first brought back <unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) .
Although there are many questions about Dogen 's birth , there are various theories on the fact that he was born in the direct line of Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO ( MINAMOTO no Michichika and Michichika KOGA ) , who was Naidaijin ( Minister of the Interior ) .
According to the established theory , he was born as a son of Michichika and FUJIWARA no Ishi , a daughter of FUJIWARA no Motofusa ( Motofusa ) MATSUDONO , who was the daughter of Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) Motofusa MATSUDONO ( FUJIWARA no Motofusa ) , but recently , the theory has become widely accepted that he was the biological child of Michitomo HORIKAWA , who was the foster father .
There is also a theory that Michichika 's son MINAMOTO no Michimune , MINAMOTO no Michimune , and Michiteru KOGA were his father .
According to the biography " <unk> " ( The Diary of <unk> ) , he lost his father ( Michichika ) at the age of three , lost his mother at the age of eight , and was adopted by his older paternal half - brother , Michitomo HORIKAWA .
According to one theory , after the death of his parents , he wanted to adopt his maternal uncle Moroie MATSUDONO ( former regent and minister of the Interior ) , who was his maternal uncle , as an adopted heir of the Matsudono family , but it is also said that Dogen , who felt the impermanence of the world , declined .
There is a theory that Shinran , the founder of the Jodo Shinshu Sect , had a relationship with each other , but it is not confirmed .
There is a theory that the volume of his work " Shobogenzo " ( Treasury of True Teaching ) was written for Shinran .
In 1213 , he visited his maternal uncle <unk> on Mt. Hiei .
In 1214 , he became a priest with the title of Tendai - zasu ( head priest of the Tendai sect ) , Daigo - ji Temple , and took the name of Dogen .
In 1215 , he studied the Tendai sect under <unk> of Onjo - ji Temple .
He studied under Myozen , a disciple of Eisai at Kennin - ji Temple in 1217 .
In 1223 , along with Myozen , he went over Mt. Mimoro from Hakata to the Southern Sung Dynasty and received Inka ( Certification of spiritual achievement ) from Nyojo Tendo of the Soto sect .
In 1228 , he returned to Japan .
He founded Kosho - ji Temple in Fukakusa , Kyoto in 1233 .
At that time , he was oppressed by Mt. Hiei .
In July 1243 , he was invited by Yoshishige HATANO , jito ( manager and lord of manor ) of Echizen Province and moved to Echizen <unk> no sho ( manor in Echizen Province ) .
On the way , the invitation of Nobutsuna SASAKI , the feudal lord of Kutsuki - mura , Kutsuki - mura , <unk> - mura ( the origin of Kosho - ji Temple ( Takashima City ) )
He founded Osaragi - ji Temple in Kasamatsu in 1244 .
In 1246 , he changed the name of Osaragi - ji Temple to Eihei - ji Temple and changed his go to <unk> .
At this time , he went down to Kamakura to invite the regent Tokiyori HOJO and Yoshishige HATANO .
The period of edification in Kamakura was six months , but it was the beginning of pure Zen in the Kanto region .
In 1253 , he handed over Eihei - ji Temple to his disciple Koun Ejo , and died at the residence of his disciple <unk> <unk> ( Takatsuji - dori Street , Kyoto City ) , and at the age of 54 ( 53 years old ) .
The cause of death is said to have been <unk> .
Even if it was completed by a certain level of level , it was not to be completed , and even if it would become a Buddha , it was the essence of Buddhahood ( <unk> ) , which was the essence of Buddhahood ( <unk> ) , and Shaka , followed by mediation , insisted that it was the supreme practice ( <unk> ) .
Many of the Kamakura Buddhism agreed on the Mappo - shiso ( the end of the Dharma ) , but " Shobogenzo - ki " describes that ' we can see this word , " <unk> , " and this word is not true .
It is a hoben ( expedient ) for a long time to stand Shozo <unk> ( <unk> ) in Buddhism .
The truth of the story is only the truth .
We should have been able to gather all the things .
He was not always good at the time of a Buddhist priest .
There is also a reflection of the mysterious and mysterious nature , and it becomes a calm mind .
It means that Buddha , Buddhist precepts , and so on , and all sentient beings and <unk> ( people living in the world ) .
All the people became a priest of Buddhism .
When I am not able to do so , I should not be able to do anything , and I will not always have any excellent disciples of Shakyamuni 's disciples , so that Mappo denied Mappo ( the end of the Edo period ) as a result of the theory of hoben .

Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum , located in <unk> - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture , is a storage facility for steam locomotives managed by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) .
On October 10 , 1972 , the Japan National Railways started its 100th anniversary of its opening , and the Japan National Railways started its establishment of the Umekoji Engine Station in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , using the <unk> of Umekoji Engine Depot , which was a facility of the Umekoji Engine Depot , and in the first century , it was the first Japanese facility to preserve the steam locomotives that had been supported by Japan 's transportation .
With the division and privatization of Japan National Railways in 1987 , JR West took over the company .
This facility was also a regular car ( Umekoji Ward ) , and it is also conducted by the JNR <unk> diesel locomotives owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway and the JNR <unk> diesel locomotives .
In the first place , this facility was established to preserve steam locomotives , which had rapidly disappeared from the latter half of the 1960 's .
At first , Oyama Ward , which was located in Oyama Station , Tochigi Prefecture , was the most likely candidate for the preservation of the body , but it was located in ' the central part of Japan ' and therefore , Umekoji Ward ( at that time ) was officially selected as a preservation body in 1970 .
Although it was considered to be selected as the oldest car ( if possible ) existing in principle , there were some cars that were supposed to be selected as the C62 C62 C62 Type 2 , like those of the C62 <unk> .
The facilities were derived from " Steam Locomotive Museum " which used the <unk> and a <unk> of the former Umekoji Engine Depot , " and " Museum of Historical Materials , " which was relocated and restored the former Nijo Station building .
The <unk> - <unk> was a reinforced concrete structure constructed in 1914 , and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the <unk> - <unk> ( completed in 1915 ) and the <unk> Line .
In 2004 , it was preserved for the Civil Engineering Heritage for the study of Kokkagakkai .
In 2006 , the former Nijo Station building ( exhibition hall ) , a model - shaped steam locomotive and a set of tools , which had been preserved by JR West , were designated as quasi - railway monuments .
The former Nijo Station building was constructed in 1904 by imitating the Heian - jingu Shrine , in consideration of its scenery , in consideration of the fact that it was the oldest wooden building that the Kyoto Railway constructed in the present day .
The Kyoto Railway was nationalized in 1907 , and it was later used as a station building of JR West , but in 1996 , it ended up its role as a station building when the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) and Hanazono Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) were elevated , and it was moved to the main building and reconstructed in 1997 as a entrance hall , and used the old ticket room as a museum .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
In the <unk> - <unk> , 16 domestic steam locomotives manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period ( 16 cars were initially opened ) are displayed and displayed .
At the beginning of the opening , there were two types of <unk> and <unk> , and they were registered by 15 cars , but later , the subject of the preservation of cars were reviewed several times , and now , in 2006 , the preservation machine has become 7 - ryo 7 - 7 - ryo .
Among them , five cars are still registered as a car , and 2 cars ( C57 <unk> , 56 <unk> ) are served on the main line of the Yamaguchi Line , such as ' Yamaguchi ( train ) ' and ' Kita Biwako ' ( train ) on the Hokuriku Main Line .
Although there are some <unk> other than these two locomotives , it is impossible to run on the main line because it is not fully inspected .
In addition , the ' SL SL <unk> ' ( SL SL <unk> ) , which was pulled by the steam machine for display in the museum , is operated by the railway .
This display route was once extended from the depot to the north of the site where a large - sized car parking lot was now available ( a rest facility and a park used to be used for the premises ) , but was moved to the north of the former Nijo Station building building , and was changed to the present Umekoji Park , along with the relocation of the former Nijo Station building building building building building , to run along the Sagano Line .
It is still connected with the operating line as a facility .
After the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company was closed , it was also maintained by steam locomotives .
Plum trees
It originates from ' Ume ' ( plum tree ) , which means Umekoji .
Except for all of the C62 Type <unk> , which had been designated in 1976 , all of them were designated as quasi - quasi - quasi - railway monuments along with the number of cars and the <unk> of conservative tools in 2006 .
The procedure to transfer the former organization organization from the former affiliated ward was taken in 1972 , unless specified .
The left - hand priest has no registered car since it has been preserved in Umekoji .

Shomyo is one of the Japanese traditional music .
It is a religious music used for rituals in Buddhist scriptures and Buddhist scriptures and is used for rituals .
In Japan , it is also called <unk> or <unk> .
In the old style , it is written as <unk> .
It is one of the fields of ancient India .
The term " Shomyo " refers to five fields of learning : Shomyo ( phonology , grammar , and grammar ) , <unk> ( science ) , <unk> ( science ) , Inmyo ( learning ) , Inmyo ( learning ) ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , and <unk> ( ethics ( ethics ) , and Buddhist scholars ) .
It was introduced to Japan along with the introduction of Buddhism .
In 754 , a Buddhist memorial service was held at the time of the Kaigen - hoyo ( ceremony to consecrate the Great Buddha ) of Todai - ji Temple , and it is believed that Shomyo was actively practiced in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai handed down the Buddhist hymns and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and the Shingon Shomyo .
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect also have their own chanting of the sect , and they are still handed down .
The chanting of the Buddhist hymns was passed down by a <unk> , so the score was not provided .
Therefore , the initiation of the school was extremely difficult .
Later , the score of the score was invented .
In addition , there are differences in terms of professional terms such as hakase ( professor ) depending on each school .
However , the meaning of hakase is a reference for chanting , and if to learn Shomyo , it is necessary to practice kuden ( oral instruction ) ( also called <unk> ) , and it is necessary to maintain and inherit the school from the teacher to his disciples .
Therefore , it was necessary to educate the leader and successor successors .
With various conditions , many schools were abolished .
The Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) introduced by Saicho became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) , and developed its own independent development .
After Saicho 's death , Ennin and <unk> grew .
Ryonin , the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu , is known as the restorer of the temple .
In 1109 , Ryonin built Raigo - in Temple ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) in Ohara , Kyoto .
The sango ( literally , " mountain name " ) , which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple in Ohara , was written as <unk> ( literally , " mountain name " ) , which was the origin of Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) in China , and was called <unk> .
Later , the two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the training hall of Ohara School Shomyo Shomyo .
In addition , <unk> HARA later had no school , and there was a statement of the two schools in Ohara .
Later , a Buddhist monk <unk> restored Ohara Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) .
<unk> built a new school based on the theory of music .
After that , the central part of the Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) was held , and it was handed down to the present Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu sect , Jodo sect and Jodo Shinshu sect Shomyo ( chanting of the Buddhist hymns ) are of the Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) .
The mantra chanting of the Shingon sect is based on Kukai 's tradition , and it has become the basis of the present day .
It was after Shinga that the chanting of Buddhist hymns had been systematized .
It can be said that Kancho was the founder of the renaissance .
He worked for the music and maintenance of Shomyo ( Buddhist hymns ) .
Until the Kamakura period , there were many schools , but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakugyo , and was compiled into four schools ( the <unk> - ryu , the Shin - <unk> - ryu , the Daigo - ryu , the Daigo - ryu , and the Nakagawa Daishin - ryu ) .
The reading of Kogi Shingon Sect declined and disappeared from the Edo period .
The <unk> - ryu , Shin - in - in , Daigo - ryu and Daigo - ryu were abolished until around the middle of the Meiji period .
At present , it is divided into <unk> Shomyo ( Chishaku - in Temple in Kyoto ) , <unk> Shomyo ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) ( Hase - dera Temple ) , <unk> ( Mt. Koya , Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The chanting of the Shingon sect Chisan Shomyo , Buzan Shomyo ( Shingi Shingon sect ) , Buzan school , Buzan school , Shingon sect Buzan school , and both schools were originally derived from the Nakagawa Daishin School .
Raiyu adopted the school of Daigo .
In 1583 , when Negoro - ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and fell into decline , both of Chisan and Buzan were formed based on the old school of Daigo .
Its characteristics are ' <unk> ' ( debate ) of Buzan and ' Shomyo ' ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) .
The <unk> School ( Kogi Shingon sect <unk> ) was founded by the Nakagawa <unk> School .
The Nakagawa Daishin - ryu school was founded by the senior secretary of Nakagawa - ji Temple in Nara .
In the Joei era ( 1232 - 1233 ) , the base of Koyasan <unk> and Sanbo - in Temple was moved to Mt. Koya .
Later , it was named Nanzan - san , which was another name of Mt. Koya , and was named Nanzan - san .
It is also referred to as the <unk> School and the <unk> School .
The music of Heikyoku , Yokyoku , folk song , Joruri ( dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment ) , and so on can be traced back to Shomyo .
It had a significant influence on the melody melody .

June 14 , 645 : The investiture of the Crown Prince
August 24 , 661 - Shosei ( official Shosei )
Emperor Tenchi ( February 20 , 668 ) - ascended the throne
He died on January 7 , 672 at the age of 46 .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief Brief History of Japan ) , it is said that the Emperor Tenmu was killed after the death of an illness , saying , ' It is the Emperor 's horse , <unk> Yamashina no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> '
The reason why Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time was one of the mystery in the political history of the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories regarding this .
It was in consideration of Emperor Tenmu 's power .
In other words , it is wrong that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it was based on the theory that Emperor Kogyoku gave birth to Emperor Jomei before he married Emperor Jomei , and that he was the maternal half - brother of Emperor Tenchi .
In fact , the Emperor Tenmu 's birth year of birth was calculated based on the description of Emperor Tenmu 's death in some history books of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the Emperor Tenmu became the oldest person .
However , there are no contradictions between the same historical materials , and there are many historical materials that have the age of 8 to 9 .
On the other hand , there is a negative opinion that ' although the father is different , the younger brother will be sent to his older brother , ' and therefore , the age of Emperor Tenchi was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the age of the Emperor Jomei , the age of his father , Emperor Jomei , who was at the age of 16 , died when he was enthroned .
Therefore , the real year of birth was 614 , which was adopted by Honcho koin jounroku ( the Emperor 's family tree ) and so on .
In ancient times , there was no interregnum ( in fact , Emperor Tenchi and Empress Jito , who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu , also ruled the throne , and did not immediately succeed the throne .
The error was caused by the result of the error .
There is also a view that the theory of " Nihonshoki " was pointed out to be " <unk> " or " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , so there is also a different opinion that it was not identical to the other historical books .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age ' )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat by Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Prince Naka no Oe was driven out of power .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good , and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of the Prince Naka no Oe .
Thus , Prince Naka no Oe 's motive for killing Iruka was not realized .
In addition , the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) has been <unk> and this theory came to be advocated .
In this theory , the Soga clan other than Iruka had not been expelled after the coup because of the reasons for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka had not been purged , and therefore , they received attention to explain other questions .
It is said that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was delayed because of the opposition from the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi .
This suggests that Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , indicated the relationship between her wife , Hashihito no Himemiko ( younger maternal half - sister of Emperor Tenchi ) and Emperor Tenchi .
Although his love and marriage were permitted by her paternal half - brothers and sisters , she was not allowed to be allowed to love people in those days , but it was interpreted that she was actually related with a rainbow in the heavenly sky of <unk> <unk> , which was persuaded by her uncle Karu no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and she was persuaded to marry her to her , and she was caught up by Arima no miko and others , and she was caught in a scene of Arima no miko .
After the death of Empress Saimei , Hashihito no Himemiko succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the empress of the previous emperor , but some people say that the records were deleted due to some circumstances .
This is because the " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) states that the person who became ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' came from Hashihito no Himemiko , and ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' can be interpreted as the interim emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .
If Hashihito no Himemiko is referred to as ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto , ' there is a theory that she was the Empress Saimei , however , there is no evidence to prove it .
It is difficult to prove the nature of the political history and the restrictions of historical materials , but the development of research in future including cooperation with archaeological results are being made .
Poems
He was also a poet of the Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) .

Saion - ji Temple was a court noble who was descended from the Fujiwara clan .
The family was descended from the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan , and its social standing was the Seiga family .
The Toin family and the Imadegawa family ( Kikutei family ) were separated from the Saionji family .
The Saionji clan , a samurai family in Iyo Province , was also a powerful branch of the Saionji family who used the family name of Saionji .
Its family crest is Hidari mitsudomoe ( three comma - shaped comma - shaped figures ) .
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Suemichi , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane .
When Kintsune SAIONJI , the great - grandson of Michisue , married MINAMOTO no Yoritomo 's niece as his wife during the Jokyu War , he was placed in confinement in the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and after the Jokyu War , he gained the trust of the bakufu and gained the real power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi ( liaison officer in the Kanto region ) and raised his family status to Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) .
The family name of Saion - ji Temple derives from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his second residence in Kyoto ( Kitayama - no - sho , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono , and the present Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA over this land .
He was supported by the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) from Kintsune , and gained power over the Sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) through the Kamakura period .
Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) and gave his daughter to Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
After his son , Kinhira SAIONJI , however , the Daikakuji - to line came to place a distance from the bakufu , and this led to a conflict with the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) .
Later , in the era of Kinmune SAIONJI , the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) fell and was dismissed from Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO ( Tokioki ) , who was the remnants of the Hojo clan , and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration , and planned a scheme to assassinate the Retired Emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin - to ( imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu ) , and the plot was revealed by his younger brother , Kinshige SAIONJI , and was executed .
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Sanetoshi SAIONJI , the son of Kinmune SAIONJI , served the Northern Court ( Japan ) and became Udaijin ( Minister of the Right ) and restored the family name .
In the Muromachi and Edo periods , it was also known as a family that specialized in biwa .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI invited Tadataka HOSOKAWA , the legitimate son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later disinherited ) , and his eldest daughter Tokuhime , who was the heir of Kyumu NAGAOKA , to become a Midaidokoro ( a wife of a shogun ) , and was promoted to Sadaijin ( Minister of the Left ) , but Nagaoka Kyumu NAGAOKA received funds for various purposes from the Saionji family and donated 600 koku ( <unk> ) .
At the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from the Tokudaiji family of the same Kanin line , and after the Meiji Restoration , he was active as a politician and served as Prime Minister , and he played an important role in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods as a Genro .
In addition , Kinmochi was not like playing biwa ( Japanese lute ) , which was supposed to be the family business of the Saionji family , but he was said to have been in the prime minister 's service that ' I want to listen to the biwa of the Saionji family for a long time , ' and there is an anecdote that he was forced to play together with gagaku ( ancient Japanese court dance and music ) player of the Imperial Household Ministry and biwa ( Japanese lute ) .

According to the afterword , the work of <unk> was completed around 996 , and the Sachujo ( Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards ) MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa brought it from the house of the author and spread it to the public .
After that , the book was added to the book , and it is considered that it was written around the end of the year .
The text of " The Tale of Genji , " which was drawn in " The Tale of Genji " by Genji Monogatari ( The Tale of Genji ) , does not exist in the text of " The Pillow Book , " and it seems to have a complicated process .

Also , because the Noin version was used as the original text for old type printing in the early Edo period ( Kanei era ) , it became a set of commentaries such as " Makura no Soshi <unk> " ( The Pillow Book ) and " Makura no Soshi <unk> " ( Commentary on the Pillow Book ) ( written by Kigin KITAMURA ) , which became a commentary on " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) and " Makura no Soshi <unk> " ( Commentary on the Pillow Book ) .
However , in 1946 , Jutaro TANAKA ( 1917 - 1987 ) re - reevaluated the third edition of the third volume , and after the Second World War , it became a result of the publication of the textbooks .

The sophisticated sense of the author and the <unk> of the art of the art of the art of the art , combined with the ' beauty of things ' in " The Tale of Genji , " and made the beauty of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , which was an aesthetic form of " <unk> " ( <unk> ) .

The expression ' <unk> ' ( Spring Dawn ) is a fresh novel of " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , which is seen in " Kokin Wakashu " ( Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) , which is seen in the Kokin Wakashu ( Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) at that time , followed by the <unk> of " Haru - Hana - Hana - hana - hana - hana - hana - <unk> " ( Spring and Autumn ) , which was a <unk> of the aesthetic consciousness of readers who were accustomed to the traditional Japanese poetry .
She showed great respect to chugu Teishi .
It was written in order to console Teishi 's soul , who died after Michitaka 's death , during the unfortunate years of death , when the Michitaka family declined .
Therefore , it is natural to say that the decline of the Michitaka family was not written ( same as the above - mentioned above ) .
Even in the period of despair , even when people who surround chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) and chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) were in despair , they also claimed that they lived in the world of Yoshihisa ( Ueno no ri [ law of Kozuke Province ] ) .
Public evaluation
It appears in <unk> ( <unk> AKIYAMA ) who tried to forget the class from Sei Shonagon to assimilate into the upper reaches of the school .
( This is because it does not have any honorific title for those who have high social status than their relatives . )
It was just a ' Record of Civilization in the empress 's residence ' and was not written by the qualification of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ISHIDA ) .
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( also known as Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) was the 15th seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ( his reign was from January 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 ) .
He was the only shogun who did not work as a shogun in Edo - jo Castle .
He served as a great vassal of the Imperial Court , First Order of Merit .
He was a member of the House of Peers .
After Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the 14th Shogun , who had acted as a guardian of the shogun , died , he assumed the post of the 15th shogun of the Edo bakufu .
After the Emperor Meiji returned the political power to the Imperial Court ( Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) ) , he tried to unite the imperial court and the shogunate , but in the Battle of Toba and Fushimi , after the Restoration of Imperial Rule , he returned from Osaka - jo Castle to Edo - jo Castle , leaving the former Shogunate army , and was ordered to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court , and surrendered Edo - jo Castle without any bloodshed .
After he was removed from house arrest in the Meiji period , he devoted himself to hobbies and lived as a prince until the Taisho period .
Yoshinobu ' is also read as ' <unk> ' or ' <unk> ' as his common name .
In the official documents of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , there is a record that " <unk> " was read as " <unk> . "
His name was written as ' <unk> ' in the English language and English newspaper by himself .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' <unk> ' , but in Shizuoka City , which spent the rest of his life , he is often called ' <unk> . '
According to the person who knew Yoshinobu while he was alive , Yoshinobu himself liked to be called ' <unk> ' and he also used his name ' <unk> ' to his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
It is said that Yoshinobu succeeded Yoshinobu as well as Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA , who was also known as ' <unk> ' by people around him .
It is considered that there are two ways of calling them ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> san ' ( <unk> ) , and it is quite rare today , but it can be confirmed not only in Shizuoka but also in various places , and it is often used to refer to " <unk> " ( <unk> ) .
Ryotaro SHIBA said that ' the people called " <unk> " were mostly related to the former retainers of the shogun , but it is possible that they were highly respected in a wide range of areas because they could be used even by people related to the Higo Domain , who had worked for overthrowing the Shogunate , and were treated favorably . '
He was born on September 29 , 1837 as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was the shogun who adopted the lawful wife of Imperial Princess Yoshiko ( the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is considered to be the lawful wife of his father Hidetada , but there is also a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was <unk> .
In accordance with Nariaki 's education policy , ' the boy grew up in his hometown , ' he moved to the Mito Domain seven months after his birth , and lived there until he inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and was taught about learning and martial arts from <unk> and others .
It seems that Yoshinobu 's <unk> was taken attention from that time , and Nariaki was not adopted by other families , and at first , he thought that he would be able to hand over his eldest son Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA 's hand .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered him to appoint <unk> to the Mito Domain as a successor of the Hitotsubashi family .
After this , Shichiro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December , he took the name of Yoshinobu from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi - tei residence , and thought Yoshinobu as a leading candidate for the heir of the shogun , but he gave up his decision on the advice of Masahiro ABE , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) .
In 1853 , in the midst of the confusion in the arrival of the Black Ships , Ieyoshi died of illness , and Iesada TOKUGAWA , the 13th shogun , who succeeded Ieyoshi , had no chance to have a son , had no chance to have a son , and therefore , there was a problem that ' the heir of the shogun ' ( the heir of the shogun ) would be born ( the issue of the heir ) .
The Hitotsubashi group , including Nariaki , Masahiro ABE , the lord of Satsuma Domain , Nariakira SHIMAZU , and the Nanki group , including Naosuke II , the lord of the Hikone Domain who recommended Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA , the real mother of Iesada , Honjuin , opposed Yoshinobu .
The Hitotsubashi group tried to make Tenshoin , an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , to the O - oku ( the inner halls of Edo Castle ) , but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another , the Tairo ( chief minister ) Naosuke II , who became the Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 , decided that ' the heir of the Shogun Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA should be ' .
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States .
Yoshinobu went to the castle with Nariaki , Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of Fukui Domain , and others , and questioned Naosuke , but he was accused of his crime at the castle , and in 1859 , he retired ( Ansei no Taigoku [ suppression of extremists by Shogunate ] ) .
Yoshinobu himself sent Nariaki a letter that says , ' I would not want to be an heir to the shogun , but I would not want to do so , ' which is why I will not take advantage of the whole country , but I will not be taken . '
In 1860 , he was suspended from house arrest .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy , Shigetomi OHARA , who was guarded by the Satsuma Domain soldiers led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , entered Edo and ordered him to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as the guardian of the shogun , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga ) to Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On August 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as Shogun 's guardian and Shungaku to Seiji sosai ( President of the Government ) .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku carried out the reformation of the shogunate government , called Bunkyu Reforms , and they implemented the <unk> of Kyoto shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) , <unk> of Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In 1863 , he went up to Kyoto as a pioneer of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the shogun , and he worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court , which urged the expulsion of foreigners .
Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , so Iemochi had to carry out Joi ( expulsion of foreigners ) if he received a sword from the Emperor and received a sword from the Emperor , so he called himself ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) to Iemochi and made him go up to the audience .
When the Sonno Joi group centered on the Choshu Domain was expelled from the Choshu Domain in the Coup of August 18 , he returned to Kyoto again to participate in the Council of Sanyo ( Councilor ) by the Kobu Gattai ( integration of the shogunate and the shogunate ) and the Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Shogun ) .
However , if the conference was not concluded , he was drunk at drinking parties with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko , and he intentionally questioned Munenari DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , who were together with him , and furthermore , he also tried to break up the system of the Shimazu clan by saying ' We should be given by Shimazu , ' and so on .
After that , he stayed in Kyoto and was appointed as the Governor of the Imperial Palace , and was appointed as the Governor - General of the Imperial Palace , together with Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Aizu Domain ) , the governor of the Aizu Domain , Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Kuwana Domain ) , and the Imperial Court ( the Aizu Domain , Aizu and Kuwana Domain ) , together with the pro - Imperial supporters and the court nobles ( the system of the Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA and his retainers of the Mito Domain , including Kounsai TAKEDA , who supported Yoshinobu , were <unk> .
In 1864 , he commanded the army of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) in the Kinmon Incident and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of the Choshu Domain was finished , he worked hard for the imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States , which had been an imperial sanction , and succeeded in obtaining an Imperial sanction on condition .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an Imperial order to suppress the Satsuma clan 's <unk> .
However , the Satsuma Domain refused to send troops to the Satsuma Domain , which had formed the Satsuma Alliance , and the bakufu army was defeated .
On August 20 , during the second conquest of Choshu , Shogun Iemochi died at Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu made a campaign to the Imperial Court and raised an Imperial edict to suspend the fire , and succeeded in concluding a cease - fire agreement .
Although Iemochi was recommended to succeed Iemochi 's position , Yoshinobu firmly declined the offer .
On September 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family succeeded to the position of shogun , but the position of shogun was refused .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) and others requested him to become shogun , but they did not accept it , and on January 5 , they were appointed to shogun by the Imperial proclamation of Emperor Komei .
In other words , this was intended to make a shogun by selling the favor of the Emperor , and to make a shogun more advantageous to the government .
Yoshinobu established Yokosuka Iron Factory , Construction Construction and <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) from France through the assistance of French minister Léon Léon Léon <unk> , and invited military advisers including Jules Brunet to reform the military system .
Also , his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was sent to Paris World Exposition , and encouraged his children 's students to study in Europe .
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port , he insisted on the Imperial Court and received an imperial sanction .
Yoshinobu , who had been going down to Satsuma and Choshu , reported the Imperial Court to the Emperor on October 14 , 1867 to the throne ( Taisei Hokan ) , and received an Imperial sanction ( Taisei Hokan ) .
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time judged that there was no administrative ability , and tried to continue the Tokugawa government by leading feudal lords 's council .
However , the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in January , and Yoshinobu was ordered to ' Jikan nochi ' ( the Minister of the Interior and the Tokugawa 's territory ) ( dedicated to the Imperial Court ) .
Yoshinobu left the Osaka - jo Castle to avoid a conflict , and gathered foreign ministers and other ministers of foreign countries and claimed to be the legitimacy of Tokugawa , and then , he made the Imperial Court a movement to <unk> the Jikan nochi to calm the calm form .
However , the following year , 1868 , he raised an army in Edo by provoked by the Satsuma Domain in Edo , and blocked Kyoto by using the soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana Domains .
However , in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , which broke out on January 3 , when the former Shogunate army faced a disadvantageous situation in the battle of Toba - Fushimi , he left his soldiers behind and withdrew to Edo with " <unk> " ( literally , " <unk> " ) .
Soon after that , the Imperial army led by Prince Arisugawa no Miya Taruhito started to attack Yoshinobu as an enemy of the Emperor 's enemy .
Yoshinobu insisted on deference to Yoshinobu , in keeping the resistance party including Tadaosa OGURI and others .
In February , he left Kaishu KATSU to settle the situation , and he himself confined himself to the Daiji - in Temple of Kanei - ji Temple in Ueno .
The head of the Tokugawa family was transferred to his adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU ( later Iesato TOKUGAWA ) .
After negotiations with Katsu and Takamori SAIGO , the staff of the government army , were surrendered , Yoshinobu was transferred to Mito and kept under house arrest at the Kodokan school .
In July , he moved to Suruga Province , which was transferred from the Tokugawa family .

Even after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he practiced shuriken ( shuriken ) in his forehead and was counted as the most famous person among the masters of shuriken .
When his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , tried to make a problem when he was a successor of the Tokugawa family , he had a <unk> ( a <unk> ) in order to <unk> the Tokugawa family , and when his father Nariaki died , he had a mistake in the pillow ( it seems that he had to have been removed when he was not injured ) .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote that when he came of age , he went to sleep with three people , as a measure to assassinate him , he was sleeping with two concubines and concubines , as well as one of his wives and concubines .
Although Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph of his childhood , it is questionable whether he was Yoshinobu himself .
It is said that he visited Iemochi who fell ill and came to ask him to visit him , and then he exchanged it for a common time .
Tatewaki AJIMA , who was known as a faithful retainer of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , who was the biological father of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , praised Yoshinobu as ' a person who tried to flow the Tokugawa family , ' and when Yoshinobu was looking at the expectation of recovery , he took the role of the Shogun and took the role of ' the second coming of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , ' he was praised by Hideaki .
Hideaki of Yoshinobu was also well known for the anti - shogunate group , and Takayoshi KIDO of Choshu Domain , especially Takayoshi KIDO , who was a member of the Choshu clan , did not have a good relationship with Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI .
He was wary of Ieyasu 's coming of life . '
In response to the decision of Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , Ryoma SAKAMOTO said , " The great shogun ( shogun ) , and the present - day suicide will be realized .
It may be said that he was often punished .
He praised Yoshinobu as ' I am alive for my loyalty , ' and tried to give Yoshinobu the position of vice chief chancellor of the new government to him .
However , it was in the Meiji period that Yoshinobu himself knew the existence of Ryoma 's personality ( after Ryoma 's death ) .
It was not only Yoshinobu but was known for Ryoma 's reputation during his lifetime , and it was very low than that after the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi and ran back to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy 's side by saying ' the enemy 's escape . '
At that time , the umajirushi of <unk> ( a gold - shaped Japanese horse - shaped flag ) , which had been taken since Ieyasu , were forgotten , but some of the favorite concubines were accompanied by him without forget , and some people <unk> Yoshinobu 's favorite concubine .
However , there is also a view that , at that time , there was a need to resist armed ikki in Edo and Musashi Province , and Yoshinobu had to become an enemy of the Emperor , and that there was no way to prevent foreign intervention from being able to avoid the war even if he had been able to guard Osaka - jo Castle .
On the other hand , he was regarded as a person who valued the Emperor and the Imperial Court because he was considered to be an enemy of the Emperor , or because he was confined to Kanei - ji Temple , but it is considered that he had a great influence on Mitogaku ( Mitogaku ) , which was thought to have been a thought of reverence for the emperor and the Imperial Court ( it is considered that he was from the Imperial Family ) , and on the other hand , he did not have a good reputation as a lord , and therefore , he was also said to have been ' weak . '
Due to deference to the new government , bloodless surrender of the Edo Castle , the independence of the government was protected by the modern Japan due to the bloodless transfer of the government , and it was highly evaluated that the Meiji Restoration had a great achievement .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed as the head of the Hitotsubashi - Tokugawa family , and had a friendly relationship with him even after the Meiji Restoration .
SHIBUSAWA , in the later days of Yoshinobu , tried to compile a biography of Yoshinobu , and persuaded Yoshinobu to persuade him , and opened the ' <unk> - kai ' ( <unk> ) .
The " <unk> <unk> " was compiled .
In a part of the book , it can be said that Yoshinobu 's old age was able to see him as a matter of view .
He was asked for a good reason because he was at the age of <unk> , and when he knew that ' Hisamitsu SHIMAZU did n't like Hisamitsu , ' ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a <unk> person , ' he showed his feelings and feelings of his personality .
Based on these materials , " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA 's official introduction " was completed after Yoshinobu 's death .
In order to show his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji , who gave the title of duke , who was the highest rank of the nobility , to give him the title of duke , which was regarded as an enemy of the Emperor , Yoshinobu left his will to offer his funeral in Shinto rather than a Shinto funeral .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was built in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family , which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family , not in the Kanei - ji Temple Tokugawa family 's graveyard but also in Yanaka Cemetery , which was the same as that of the Imperial family .
This was because the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was impressed by the fact that the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was simple and modest ( " Tokugawa Yoshinobu <unk> " ) .
After he was pardoned , Yoshinobu spent his life in a quiet life without thinking of the former shogun 's retainers who had dedicated his life to him , and Katsukiyo ITAKURA , a roju ( senior councilor ) at that time , regretted that ' Yoshinobu acted with Yoshinobu . '
Although there was a <unk> image of ' <unk> ' ( escape ) in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , it was recently taken into effect that Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Historical drama ) was involved in the development of a new modern political system after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and some of them were re - evaluated .
As with his father Nariaki , pork of the Satsuma Domain was fond of the Satsuma Domain , and it was called " <unk> " ( literally , " pork - like " ) .
In addition , in his later years , he was interested in Western culture , liked bread and milk , and enjoyed his hobbies such as photographs , photographs by camera , fishing , bicycle , <unk> , <unk> , and handicraft ( embroidery ) , but it seems that he learned French from Amane NISHI ( illuminator ) , however , he failed .
Although he was famous as a camera , he seems to have never improved the camera skills .
Although he frequently contributed to the photo magazines , it is said that he did not have been adopted for a long time .
His great - grandson , <unk> TOKUGAWA , was also a freelance camera and a photograph that Yoshinobu had been taken over by the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family , including the filming of Yoshinobu , was discovered and compiled and edited .
This was a friend of a person 's hobbies , and his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
She married Mikako ICHIJO on December 3 , 1856 ( changed her name to Mikako after the Meiji Restoration ) .
The eldest daughter ( <unk> <unk> ) was born on July 16 , 1858 , but died young on July 20 .
Since then , he had no children with <unk> , and all 10 sons and 11 daughters born in the Meiji period were born between them and two concubines .
The seven sons , <unk> , who became a prince and succeeded the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family , and 10 sons , <unk> , who became an adopted son - in - law of Kaishu KATSU , <unk> , and Keishi , who became the wife of Fushimi no Miya Prince Hiroyasu , were adopted .
Princess Kikuko , the wife of the Imperial Prince Nobuhito , and others , were the children of <unk> .

Note
Nara <unk> is a railway line ( main line ) of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) , which runs from Kizu Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) to Kyoto Station in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
The entire line is included in the large urban suburban section .
As the history of the Kansai Main Line has been established as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , the formal starting station is Kizu Station , but the trains that go from Kyoto to Kizu Station ( the number of trains is odd ) and the opposite trains ( even even in the same number ) are the inbound train .
Except for the following routes , the following items are specified : For the direction of Kizu from Kyoto to Kizu .
The color of the line is brown ( <unk> ) , and the reason for selecting is that ' the image of Classic of Ancient Capital connecting two ancient capitals . '
Jurisdiction ( business type ): West Japan Railway Company ( railway operator )
Railway distance ( operating kilometers ): <unk> km
Track gauge : 1067 mm
Number of stations : 19 ( including the starting and last stations )
Double - tracked section : Shinden - Uji section , JR Fujinomori - Kyoto section
Electrified section : entire line electrified ( DC1500V )
Block system ( railway ) : automatic block system ( double track section ) , single - track automatic block system ( single track section )
Safety device : Automatic Train Stop device
Operation Center : Shin - Osaka General Control Center
Maximum speed : 110 km / h ( double track section ) , 95 km / h ( single track section )
Except for Kizu Station , Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto Branch of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) Kyoto Branch ( Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company ) .
Although the line between Kyoto and Kizu was named the Nara Line , the entire line is located in Kyoto Prefecture and there is no route in Nara Prefecture .
This was originally constructed by Nara Railway , but it was separated from the Kizu - south section as a part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the merger of the Kansai Railway Company .
However , the trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station on the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) , and run to Nara Prefecture .
After the revision of March 13 , 1988 , the JR West established a nickname for each line of the Urban Network ( such as the JR Kyoto Line and the JR Kobe Line ) , but the Nara Line was sent to the Nara Line .
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is also on the Kintetsu Corporation , it is sometimes referred to as ' JR Nara Line . '
In the era of Japan National Railways , it was guided by the ' Japan National Railways Nara Line ' and the English notation of the guide board was also used .
The Kintetsu Nara Line is related to the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is in a rival relationship .
While many trains of the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel with the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated since the past , the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 at the end of the JNR National Railways , and even after the electrification , only two local trains of the JNR Series 105 electric cars ran on a small track .
However , after the inauguration of JR West , the operation of the trains was rapidly improved by combining the four - car trains ( six - car trains ) in the Urban Network , and the number of rapid trains including the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and the number of rapid trains including the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and so on .
At present , it has a strong character as a commuter and school route from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture , such as Uji City , where the Uji City is along the line , and Joyo City .
However , the section between Momoyama Station and Shinden Station , which runs on the east side of the line , has a gap between the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and the areas that run parallel with the central part of the town .
Although the cars are used for the Nara Train Yard of the Osaka branch , the facilities of the station are managed by the Kyoto branch , except for Kizu Station .
J - Through , ICOCA , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , and PiTaPa of Surutto KANSAI can be used .
The simplified ticket gates are also provided in the section south of Joyo Station , because the station is unmanned .
Since the Express ' Kuroshio ' ( train ) , which had been connected by the Nara Line , Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line , was abolished in 1984 , only local trains were operated by local trains until 1991 ( as for limited express trains , special express trains were operated temporarily for a while ) , and four types of local trains are currently operated .
This is the most rapid type of the Nara Line and is operated mainly during the daytime .
Basically , the train makes a connection with a local train at Uji Station with a local train at Uji Station .
The nickname of ' Miyako <unk> Rapid Service ' was decided by the general public before the start of the operation .
It is also used as a train connecting Kyoto and Nara , not only by Japanese people but also by tourists .
All the trains are operated by the JR West Series 221 , and are operated with four cars or six cars .
In the double - track section , the maximum speed is 110 km / h , and other trains are 95 km / h .
The standard required time for the train is about 44 minutes from Kyoto , and the route from Nara to Kyoto is 47 minutes .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station for two minutes , and therefore , the train goes down to Nara Station and the train goes down to Nara and the train is slightly different from the Miyakoji Rapid Service .
During the three - three days of the new year , the Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari - inari Station .
History
March 3 , 2001 : The operation started .
March 15 , 2003 : Due to the timetable revision , the train began to stop at Tofuku - ji Station and Tamamizu Station .
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours .
The trains stop at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) , which pass the ' Miyako Rapid Service . '
All the 221 series are operated with four cars or six cars .
Basically , the train makes a connection with a local train at Uji Station with a local train at Uji Station .
Like the above Miyako Rapid Service , Narayama Station , where rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line stop , runs nonstop .
Until March 2001 , when the ' Miyako <unk> Rapid Service ' appeared , the trains of the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 were used for the trains of Kyoto , Uji , Joyo ( initially passed ) , Kizu and Nara , but since then , they were not used on the Nara Line .
In the morning and evening , there are some trains that run directly to the Yamatoji Line due to the convenience of the operation .
It is operated mainly in the morning and night .
At first , the timetable was revised on March 18 , 2006 , but it was also operated on Saturdays and holidays .
Although the trains stop at every station , the local rapid trains ran for Uji Station to the direction of Kizu Station during the late night , and now , the local trains running on the section ran before the rapid trains ran away to the final station .
All the trains that run from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays use the JNR 103 series Series 103 and all of the 221 series .
In the morning rush hours , trains run directly from the Yamatoji Line for the convenience of the operation .
The Nara Line used the same color as the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and the same orange color as the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' to prevent the rapid train from <unk> of the Yamatoji Line , but the timetable was revised in March 2008 , and the rollsign of the regional rapid trains came to be used as a color of the line with the timetable revision , and the line of the section of the section was not used as a color of the line .
The timetable of the station on the north of Kamikoma Station is written with purple letters .
It is operated between Kyoto and Uji , Joyo , and Nara .
During the daytime , the Kyoto - Joyo section is operated every 15 minutes , but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station becomes a 30 - minute interval .
Basically , the cars are operated with 103 series , but they are operated with some 221 series .
In the early morning and late evening , there are some trains that run directly to the Yamatoji Line for the convenience of operation .
In the past , there were some direct trains with the Sakurai Line , but the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines due to the timetable revision on September 4 , 1994 .
Although the limited express trains were operated on the Nara Line , the limited express trains were also operated .
From 1987 to 1988 , the ' Kuroshio ' was used for the nickname of the JNR / JR Limited Express 381 electric train , and the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line , the Hanwa Line , and the Hanwa Line were operated via the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line , and the Hanwa Line .
In the Kinki edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun , which was published on January 6 , 1998 , there was a report that the operation of the limited express train was announced using the Nara Line ( as a regular train ) , but the plan was suspended after that .
It was once operated as the Miyako Miyako Leisure Line between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station ( the Kyoto - Nara Rapid Service ) , but the direct trains were n't operated on the Sakurai Line including temporary trains .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Festival , which is the nearest train to Uji Station , is held , but the train is operated during special schedule from 16 to 16:00 , and after 16 , all local trains run between Kyoto and Uji , and then all local trains run every 10 minutes .
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station .
At the time of the first three days of the new year , the special timetable of the new year was made , and the rapid train stopped at every station between Kyoto and Uji , and the number of trains was increased to increase the number of trains .
Depending on the year , some trains were set up as shuttle trains returning to Momoyama Station .
Around 1992 , the direct train to the Sakurai Line was extended to Tenri Station , mainly on Saturdays and holidays , and the special rapid train was operated for one hour .
In addition , special trains are sometimes available from all over Japan .
In particular , during the Tenri <unk> Festival on October 26 every year , the trains called ' exclusive trains for the group , ' which run from Kyoto Station to Tenri Station via the Nara Line and the Nara Line , from Kizu Station to the Nara Line , and the Nara Line , and the Sakurai Line .
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot .
JR West Series 221
The Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line are commonly used , and there are two cars , four cars , and six cars .
It is mainly used for four - car trains and six - car trains in the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and ' Rapid Service , ' but four - car trains run on the Nara Line .
Two - car trains are connected to each other at a holiday timetable .
JNR / JR Commuter Train Series 103
The 103 series Series 103 , which is used for local trains on the Nara Line , is used only for the Nara Line , and is connected with two cars , and is also operated on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during rush hour .
Some of the cars were transferred from Morinomiya Train Depot on the Osaka Loop Line .
Although the Nara Railway started operating between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station , the line between Kyoto Station and Momoyama Station , the route of the current Kintetsu Kyoto Line started to run on the route of the current Kintetsu Kyoto Line .
On the day of 1921 when the section between Baba ( current Zeze ) and Kyoto on the Tokaido Main Line was replaced by the current line via Higashiyama Tunnel , the new line between the former Tokaido Main Line and the Inari - inari Station and the Fushimi - Momoyama section became the Nara Line , and the section between Kyoto and Fushimi became a freight line .

The section between JR - Fujinomori Station and Uji Station , which is a single track section , still remains strongly rooted in the examination phase between Shinden Station and Kizu Station , but there is no concrete prospect .
The section along the National Route 24 between JR - JR - Fujinomori Station and Momoyama Station , and the Keihan Uji Line , which runs between Kohata Station and Uji Station ( near Obaku Station ) , are especially difficult to secure the land for the land .
Because of the shortage of budget , it is possible that the Sagano Line ( the Sanin Main Line Kyoto Line and Sonobe Station ) would have been promoted to a double - tracked line .
In the Kinki Regional Transport Council , the plan to direct the line with the Tokaido Main Line ( JR Kyoto Line ) was reviewed in the future ( it was also realized when the operation of all night trains on New Year 's Eve and early New Year 's Eve ) .
Uji City planned to build a new station between Obaku Station and Uji Station .
There are no direct stations other than Rokujizo Station and Uji Station ( JR West ) .

Keiji Bypass ( <unk> ) is a bypass of general National Highway Road that runs from Kusatsu City , Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama - cho , Kuse County , Kyoto Prefecture .
It was designated as a local standard project .
The Keiji Bypass of the toll road says as follows : The Keiji Bypass of National Highway 1 and the National Highway Route No . 24 will be described as follows :
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway , and connects with the Otsu City and Kyoto City area , and connects with the Ritto Interchange , Nagoya City , Suita Interchange , and Osaka City area .
According to the law , the <unk> Interchange and the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange are the National Highway 1 - National Highway Route No . 478 , the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange , the Kumiyama - IC Interchange - the Kumiyama - Yodo Junction - the Kumiyama - Yodo Junction - the Kumiyama - sen Junction - National Highway Road ( National Highway Highway Highway Highway Road ) , and the National Highway Highway Highway Road ( Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway / Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) , the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange and the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange ( National Highway 2 ) , which are designated as the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway II , are the names of the Kumiyama Expressway .
In the later project , the Kyoto Daini Daini - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - doro was established , because it was necessary to make roads that have functions as a bypass of the Kyoto City and the Kyoto City .
The Kyoto Jukan Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway have been designated as National Route 478 and have consistently been maintained .
In the indication of the route , the Keiji Bypass is considered to be the Keiji Bypass in Seta Junction - Oyamazaki Junction , which is easier to understand by users .
Additionally , even if the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass pass pass through either of them , the fare fee and the ETC discount system are not different .
If otherwise specified , the Keiji Bypass ( from the Seta - higashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki Junction ) , which is a commercial name , will be described .

The Uji Tunnel of this route is the longest tunnel among National Route 1 , and the tunnel is forbidden to change the lane except for the Uji - higashi Interchange and the Kasatori Interchange .
Before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction , the film " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " was shot , and the film " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " was held .
The distance of Seta - higashi Interchange - The Oyamazaki Interchange and the Oyamazaki Interchange - Junction is slightly shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and if the Keiji Bypass runs through the Keiji Bypass , the highest speed is faster than the Keiji Bypass .
Since there are no rest space in the service area , the Meishin Expressway is crowded with Meishin Expressway ( there are two locations in the Otsu Service Area and the Katsura Parking Area ) .
However , the structure was established by the <unk> of Seta - higashi and Oyamazaki Junction ( especially the structure of Oyamazaki Junction became complicated ) , and therefore , the <unk> ( highway ) was reduced to the lower part of the <unk> ( highway ) .
If you go to the direction of Suita Junction and the Osaka area , there is a fault that if you go to the direction of Suita and Osaka , the Meishin Expressway Route is joined , the traffic jams may occur .
In addition , since many drivers who want to avoid such curves and slopes are going through the way , they have not been sufficiently able to function as a bypass of the Meishin Expressway .
This road is also a bypass of National Highway 1 ( National Highway ) , and is an exclusive highway for automobiles and is not a highway .
If you pass the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka , you must have to go to Uji - nishi Interchange .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is half - IC .
For this reason , the section between the Uji - higashi Interchange and the Uji - nishi Interchange is often congested .
Because this general road section is not connected to the <unk> , it is difficult to avoid traffic congestion .

Higashi Hongan - ji Temple , located in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture , is a Buddhist temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect .
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Shinshu sect ( the ten schools of the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) and is the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu Sect along with the Nishi Hongan - ji Temple ( formally the head temple of the Hongan - ji School of the Jodo Shinshu Sect ) .
The formal temple name was ' Hongan - ji Temple ' until 1987 and ' Shinshu Honbyo Mausoleum ' after the same year .
It is often referred to as ' <unk> - san ' because it is distinguished from Nishi Hongan - ji Temple located in the same Shimogyo Ward .
( Refer to the section of the History of Hongan - ji Temple for details on the history of the history of the temple before the split into east and west . )
Kyonyo ( Mitsutoshi ) , the twelfth chief priest of Hongan - ji Temple , was given the temple 's estate on the east side of Hongan - ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , and when Hongan - ji Temple was split into two temples in 1602 , Kyonyo founded Kyonyo .
The temple was located at Shichijo , Karasuma , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , and was named Higashi Hongan - ji Temple because it was located in the east of Nishi Hongan - ji Temple located at Horikawa Shichijo , Horikawa Shichijo .
In 1987 , Hongan - ji Temple as a religious corporation that had been integrated with Otani School and comprehensive religious corporations was legally dissolved , and was integrated with the sect .
After that , the formal name of Higashi Hongan - ji Temple became ' Shinshu Honbyo ' ( ' Hon - byo ' means the fundamental dojo ( training hall ) and the teaching of Shinran , who was accompanied by followers of the sect , who heard Shinran 's teachings .
It also means to distinguish it from the Hongan - ji school of the Jodo Shinshu sect , which was a branch of the Jodo Shinshu sect , and to insist on legitimacy .
See the East Riot .
The fire was struck four times in the Edo period , and it was so big that the fire was named ' <unk> Hongan - ji Temple ' and many existing buildings were reconstructed after the Dondon - yake , but the architecture and wall paintings were collected by the people of the time .
The Goei - do hall , which enshrines the statue of Shinran Shonin , is the largest wooden building in the world ( it is now covered with the roof of the conservation hall ) .

Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is a god ( humanized god ) appearing in Japanese Mythology .
In " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , when she was enshrined in shrines and other shrines as a natural deity , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' is referred to as ' <unk> . '
It is a god who deified the sun and is considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial Family .
In " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is described as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
It is also known as <unk> no Kami .
In the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there are several names , while " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) describes that the name of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' was unified in the shinmei ( name of a god ) .
Although it is a goddess , there is also a different theory that he was a male god .
As the shinmei ( name of god ) of Amaterasu Omikami was used in political parts such as " Kotai Kotai - jingu <unk> " ( the list of Kotai Kotai - jingu Shrine ) , there is a theory that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no Mikoto ) and Tsutomu <unk> were originally the ancestor of the Imperial Family , and that <unk> became Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
In Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , or <unk> Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and when the god is enshrined in the Shinto rituals , it is also called Amaterasu Omikami Omikami Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
In academic documents , ' Amaterasu ' and ' Kana ' ( Japanese syllabary characters ) are practiced at present .
There is a theory that it was written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) in ancient times .
Description in mythology
According to " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , when Izanagi returned from the Yominokuni ( the land of the dead ) where Izanami lived , she came to be born when he washed the left eye when he washed the impurity of the dead .
At that time , he was called Mihashira no uzuno miko ( three children ) along with Tsukuyomi , who was born from the right eye , and Susano who was born from his nose .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to govern Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susanoo , who was entrusted with the ocean , was sent to tears because he wanted to go to Nenokuni ( the underworld ) where Izanami was , and was expelled by Izanagi .
Susanoo went up to Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) to meet his older sister Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) before he went to Nenokuni , but Amaterasu Omikami felt that his younger brother came to the Plain of High Heaven , and waited for him .
To prove Susano 's innocence , Susano made a pledge to prove Susano 's innocence , and the three goddesses from Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Susano 's real god , and Susano , who was a god of five deities , were born , and Susano declared the victory .
The five gods born from the fact of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and were considered to be the son of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) were the following five gods .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
<unk>
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo , who was pleased with this , made a violent act in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amaterasu Omikami hid in Ama no iwato ( Cave of heaven ) .
The world became darkness , and various misfortunes occurred .
( Eight million gods , including <unk> no mikoto , the god of the Chichibu - no - kami ( God of Wisdom ) , and <unk> - no - mikoto , succeeded in making Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) from Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and Susano was expelled from Takamanohara ( Plain of High Heaven ) .
He descended to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( Literally , " Central Land of Reed Plains , " which refers to the Central Land of Reed Plains , Japan , which refers to the Central Land of Reed Plains ) and sent Amatsu kami ( heavenly god ) .
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni was subdued , Amenooshihomimi finally came to earth , but Ninigi 's grandson Ninigi was born and made Ninigi descended to earth .
Interpretation
In the mythology of mythology , there is a scene in which the god of Tianjin ( Takamimusubi ) , who was born earlier than him , and the god Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) performed religious services ( religious service ) and believed that Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) would have been deified as the emperor who ruled the country .
There is also a view that it was a deified divinity of a shrine maiden in ancient times .
The other name ' <unk> ' is ' Hi no onna ' ( a woman of the sun ) , which means a shrine maiden serving the sun god .
Although the sun god was originally a male god , there is a theory that a shrine maiden who served it was equated with the sun god and became a goddess .
Also , there is a theory that this goddess was established around the time of Empress Jito , who was the empress , and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
The birth of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Tsukuyomi , the sun of the sun , and moon is pointed out to have a strong influence on Dokyo and the Taoism that ' the sun of the sun and the moon ' ( prior to the sixth century ) of Taoism , the sun of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , the sun of the sun of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and the sun of the sun of Tsukuyomi , was the sun of the sun and the moon , ' and the eyes of the sun of the sun of the sun and the sun of the sun are the sun . '
It is also said that the word of the word , such as Okami ( great god ) of Ise - jingu Shrine , jingu Shrine , Saigu ( Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise - jingu Shrine ) , <unk> no Miya ( <unk> no miya ) , Murasaki no Miya ( purple robe ) , <unk> ( light purple ) , <unk> ( light light purple ) , <unk> ( five colors ) , and Toyouke no Okami ( Toyouke no Okami ) , which enshrine Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , are also combined with Taoism .
In comparison , there is pointed out that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and others correspond to the <unk> myth , which has been recorded in the older period ( three to fourth centuries ) .
Since the sun and the sun are the universal <unk> in Asia , there is also a theory that it was introduced to Japan along with the ethnic groups in the prehistoric age .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the divinity changed into three stages .
The following is a summary of the incident and the contents of the incident , which is the turning point .
645 : Taika Reforms
The Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami before this time .
The word ' kami ' ( the god of the sun ) is used .
A male god called ' <unk> ' was enshrined widely .
In " Engishiki " ( codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines that read ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' such as ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima , ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Harima Province , ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Tanba .
In addition , <unk> is another name for Amenohoakari , a grandson of Amaterasu , and Amenohoakari is also the founder of the Owari clan , Tsumori clan , and Amabe clan .
Also , the younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi and was a great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : The Jinshin War .
<unk> no Kami ' ( <unk> no <unk> ) , ' <unk> no <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> no <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , or ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In this case , there is an interpretation that the enshrined deity is a goddess 's <unk> no <unk> , and it is interpreted as a male god of <unk> .
698 : The shrine was founded .
Amaterasu ' and ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family . '
She is a goddess .
It was created by the nature god as a model for Empress Jito .
After that , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) other than the Imperial Family was called ' <unk> . '
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( around 1060 ) , the part of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' is read as ' <unk> ' and also in ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) of " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) , which is written as ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
1880 - 1881 , over the enshrined deity of Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto Jimukyoku ) in Hibiya , Tokyo , a religious dispute arose in the Shinto religion .
The Shinto Jimukyoku decided to enshrine the four deities of Zoka - sanshin ( three gods of creation ) ( Ame no Minakanushi no Kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Kamimusubi no kami ) and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) as the enshrined deities in the shrine of the clerical bureau , but ' Izumo - ha ' ( the Izumo school ) insisted that ' <unk> ' ( the same as the other world and the world ) should be governed by the five deities ( the other world ) , and that the god enshrined in the world ( the other world ) should be enshrined as ' <unk> ' ( the other world ) .
However , the ' Ise - ha ' , which played the central role of the Shinto Jimukyoku , was ' the supreme leader of the heaven and earth ' which ruled the Ryokai - Ryokai ( Two Realms Realms ) , and the other gods insisted that they were too loyal to the Emperor , and the both sides opposed the two groups .
In the end , there were various rumors , such as ' Izumo school of Izumo , which has long been passed down from the age of gods , ' ' ' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ' and so on .
Later , this dispute was settled by the decision of Emperor Meiji ( the Izumo school was defeated ) , and the divinity of Amaterasu Omikami was ranked at the highest rank .
It is said that the government acknowledged the possibility of the creation of the creed system common to Shinto , and that the modern nation recognized the possibility that the modern nation directly controlled the people through the restoration Shinto teachings .
Refer to the dispute over the enshrined deity of State Shinto Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto Jimukyoku ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA used " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , another name of " <unk> " ( <unk> ) in his own novel , when Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) appeared .
This is because the name ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) came to appear in the following sentences , so the sun god and the nature of the nature god would be called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In fact , there were many novels by Akutagawa that were not able to correct , corrections , corrections , and corrections by the army .
<unk> YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who founded <unk> Gakuin ( <unk> ) , founded <unk> ( 1898 - 1926 ) , said , ' Japan has faith in Amaterasu Omikami ( Sun Goddess ) .
Amaterasu Omikami is an ideal to <unk> the world of Japanese spirit .
The ideal of Izanami and Izanagi 's ' <unk> ' is to say , in other words , it is an ideal to go to the world of the world , to become a pioneer , pioneer , and lead . '
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami are called Shinmei - jinja Shrine , and all over the country are in the Naiku ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) of Ise - jingu Shrine ( Ise Jingu Shrine ) .
The Kotai - jingu Shrine is a Shinto shrine that enshrines one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family , the Yata no Kagami ( the eight sacred mirror ) , which is one of the Three Sacred Treasures of Japan .
Most shrines throughout Japan sell talismans ( taima ) of Kotai - jingu Shrine ( Amaterasu Omikami Kotai - jingu Shrine ) .
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) was a term derived from a large - scale myoshu .
It indicates a great number of people who have been named <unk> .
Shomyo is a shomyo ( a Buddhist name ) .
He said that he had a strong power in the region .
In the samurai society , the word came to mean a samurai who owned many shoryo ( territory ) and subordinates .
In the Muromachi period , shugo strengthened their control over their territories and became shugo daimyo ( provincial military governor ) .
In the Sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , a powerful feudal lord , who established a strong control of his own territory , appeared and was called Kokujin ( local samurai ) and Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period ) .
In the Edo period , it became a word referring to samurai families that were given more than 10,000 koku ( approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield ) by the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
Among the samurai who were less than 10,000 koku , samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called direct retainers .
Daimyo were called daimyo ( feudal lord ) because they shared the character of feudal lord and the character of feudal lords in China , and they were called daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) .
This section explains the details of the early - modern daimyo in the Edo period .
Refer to the article for the Shugo daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) and Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) .
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) in the Edo period
Daimyo in the Edo period were determined by their social standing , official ranks , ranks , positions , and shikoseki ( anteroom seats for feudal lords ) .
First , the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family was divided into the families of the Tokugawa family ( Shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , Shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , Shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , fudai daimyo ( hereditary vassal ) , which had been a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara , and Tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) who had been a vassal of the Tokugawa family .
When the shogun Ieyasu died out , the first shogun , established the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was permitted to use the Tokugawa family as well as to assist the shogun 's control , and in the case of the shogun family , he appointed Yoshinao TOKUGAWA , the ninth son , to Owari Domain , the tenth son , Yorinobu TOKUGAWA , and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA , the eleventh son of Kishu Domain , and the Mito Domain .
Furthermore , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of Ieyasu and the second son of Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to Echizen Domain , as well as other daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) of the Tokugawa family throughout the country .
Furthermore , he placed fudai daimyo ( hereditary vassal ) who built the period of the Tokugawa Shogun family as fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu as a fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) , and in addition , he placed important positions , mainly in the Roju ( senior councilor ) of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and made him decide to the shogunate government .
The fudai daimyo were relatively low , and besides , the Torii clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , the Honda clan , the Ogasawara clan , and the Ogasawara clan gained relatively <unk> koku , but the fudai daimyo who maintained 100,000 koku ( approximately <unk> million liters of crop yield ) in the Edo period including the Sakai clan , the Hotta clan , the Hotta clan , the Hotta clan , the Yanagisawa clan , and the Toda clan , were only the fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) .
This led to the separation of power and military power .
After the Battle of Sekigahara , tozama daimyo were subordinated to the Tokugawa family , and many families were opposed to the Tokugawa family in Sekigahara .
The bakufu was so cautious that the bakufu was very wary of the bakufu , and they actively carried out intelligence activities by spies and were afraid of illegal activities and rebellion , and they were severely punished by being deprived of their fief .
As a representative tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) of the Maeda clan , the Kaga Domain of the Maeda clan , the Sendai Domain of the Shimazu clan , the Fukuoka Domain of the Kuroda clan , the Hiroshima Domain , the Choshu Domain of the Mori clan , the Yonezawa Domain , the Nabeshima clan of the Saga - Uesugi clan , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Hachisuka clan , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , and the Satake clan of the Okayama Domain , and the Satake clan of the Okayama Domain , as well .
In addition , when daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) had to have a territory equivalent to a province or a person with a fief equivalent to a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) or a castle was distinguished from a daimyo ( feudal lord ) , a daimyo ( feudal lord ) who had a castle ( joshukaku ) and jinya ( regional government office ) , and a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) who had no castle or a castle with a castle , were allowed to reside in Edo - jo Castle , and they were treated as a room .
For more information , refer to " shikoseki . "
In spite of the level of daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) , the daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) with 100,000 koku were not allowed to possess a total of 100,000 koku , and most of them had territories around the castle town and spots .
In extreme cases , one village was divided into another feudal lord ( <unk> ) .
Although daimyo were generally more than 10,000 koku , the Kitsuregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was 5,000 koku of the Kitsuregawa clan .
This is because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan .
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of Buke Shohatto ( Laws for the Military Houses ) and Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In addition , they were also ordered to defend the seashore at the end of the Edo period , and daimyo were always in financial difficulties .
