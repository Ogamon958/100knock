Dogen was a Zen monk in the early Kamakura period.
He was the founder of the Soto sect.
In his later years, he was also called Maregen.
According to the religious doctrine, he was respected as the founder of the school.
His posthumous name was Bussho (仏性伝) and he was also known as Shoyo Daishi (聖陽大師).
It is generally called Dogen Zenji.
It is said that it spread the manners and customs of cleaning and cleaning during meals in Japan.
There is a theory that he was first brought back to Japan by Mouzhu (Songzun).
There are many points about the birth of Dogen, but there are various theories about the theory that he was born in the direct descendant of Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO (MINAMOTO no Michichika or Michichika KOGA) who was Naidaijin (minister of the center).
It is said that he was born as the son of FUJIWARA no Koreko, who was a daughter of Michichika and Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state) Motofusa MATSUDONO (FUJIWARA no Motofusa) at the Matsudono villa in Kohata in Kyoto, but the recent study has become widely accepted that he was the biological child of Michichika Horikawa-dori Street.
There is also a theory that he was a son of Michichika, MINAMOTO no Michimune or Michimitsu KOGA was his father.
According to a biography, "Kenkoki" (Record of the Encyclopedia), he lost his father (Michichika at the age of three) at the age of three, and became an adopted child of his older paternal half-brother, Tomu HORIKAWA.
According to one theory, after the death of his parents there was a story that he was adopted by Moroie MATSUDONO (the former regent and the Minister of the Interior) from his mother's mother's mother's side to the adopted heir of the Matsudono family, but it is said that Dogen, who felt innocent in the world.
There is a theory that the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect Shinran had a close relationship with each other on the mother's side, but there is no evidence that there is no evidence to prove it.
There is a theory that the volume of '生死' in "Shobogenzo" was written by Shinran.
In 1213, he visited his maternal uncle, Yoshiaki, on Mt. Hiei.
In 1214, he entered the priesthood under the guidance of the Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect) Koen, and he called himself Dogen of Buddhism.
In 1215, he studied the Tendai Sect doctrine under Kintane of Onjo-ji Temple.
He studied under Myozen who was a disciple of Eisai, at Kennin-ji Temple in 1217.
In 1223, he went to the Southern Sung Dynasty along with Myozen and received inka (certification of spiritual achievement) from Tendo Nyojo of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism.
He returned to Japan in 1228.
In 1233, he founded Kosho-ji Temple in Fukakusa.
Around this time, he was suppressed by Mt. Hiei.
In July 1243, he was invited by Yoshishige HATANO, a jito (manager and lord of manor) of Echizen Province, and moved to Echizen-Shihi-no-sho manor in Echizen Province.
On the way, he visited Kutsuki-mura in response to the invitation of Nobutsuna SASAKI who was the feudal lord of Kutsuki-mura Village (Takashima City).
In 1244, he founded Daibutsu-ji Temple in Kasamatsu.
In 1246, he changed the name of Daibutsu-ji Temple to Eihei-ji Temple, and his pseudonym was also changed to Maregen.
Around this time, he went down to Kamakura due to the invitation of regent Tokiyori HOJO and Yoshishige HATANO.
It was a half year during the period of teaching in Kamakura but it was the beginning of the rise of pure Zen in the Kanto region.
He handed over Eihei-ji Temple to his disciple Koun Ejo in 1253 and died at the age of 54 at the age of 54.
The cause of his death is said to have been a ulcer.
Even if becoming a Buddha, it is not perfected by a certain level of level, and even if it is a Buddha, it is the essence of the universe (Shusho ichinyo) to seek Jobutsu (becoming a Buddha), and that it is the highest practice in the way of meditation.
Most of the Kamakura Bukkyo (Buddhism of the Kamakura period) denies the Mappo thought, but in the "Shobogenzo-zuibunki" (Record of the Reception of the Final Dharma), there is no description of this word.
It is a stop for a while for a while in order to stand at the end of the statue in Buddhism.
It is only the way of teaching in reality.
It should be said that he should be in full life.
It does not necessarily mean that he was in the presence of the dead in the world.
There is a possibility that it is very unnecessary to declare the light and the bottom of the tree.
It is the reason why the precepts of Buddhism and various kinds of seals are given to people who are all all in the world, and it is the reason why they are under the ground.
It is the opportunity of all people in Buddhism.
He thought that he was not just a disciple of Shaka, and denied the Mappo (end of the world) and denied the teachings of Mappo as it was just a way that he could not become a disciple of Shaka.

Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a facility for the preservation of steam locomotives that is operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Kiki-dera Town, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, Japan National Railways opened the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Umekoji Ward in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, and it was the first facility for Japan's first time to preserve steam locomotives that continued to support the transportation of railways in Japan for one century.
In 1987, JR West succeeded to the division and privatization of JNR.
This facility itself is based on the current vehicle (Umekoji Train Depot), and is also used for inspection and repair of the JNR DE10 diesel locomotives, owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway Company (JR West) as well as by JNR Steam Locomotive Corporation.
In the first place, this facility started to establish this facility in order to preserve steam locomotives rapidly in the latter half of the 1960s.
In the beginning, it was the most convincing candidate for the Oyama district located in the precincts of Oyama, Tochigi Prefecture, which was close to the metropolitan area of the capital, but it was decided in 1970 when the Umekoji Ward (at that time) was officially selected as a preserved organ based on the fact that it was located in the 'central part of Japan.'
In principle, the cars for preservative were repeatedly examined to be selected as the most existing car (if it is equipped with a device), but there are some cars that have not been preserved, such as the C22-type No. 22.
The facilities are composed of "Steam Locomotive Hall" which utilize the Ogata type of the former Umekoji Ward and a bicycle park, and the former Nijo house was reconstructed and reconstructed as the "Materials Exhibition Hall."
The Ogata type was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914, and it was designated as a national important cultural property along with the motorcycle ceilings on December 10, 2004.
In 2004 he was elected to the World Heritage of Natural Society for Fine Arts.
In 2006, the former Nijo house (exhibition) of JR West was designated as a railway monument, and the construction of steam locomotives, which had been preserved in the Ogata Shako-depot and the Sen-device, were designated as a commemorative railway monument.
The former Nijo Station building was built in 1904 in the old Japanese style building which was built by the Kyoto Railway Company Company (JR West) as well as the main building of the main shrine, and was built to imitate Heian-jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape.
In 1907, the Kyoto Electric Railway was nationalized, and it was used as the station building of JR West after that, but in 1996, it was reconstructed and reconstructed in the premises of the main building in 1997, it was reconstructed and reconstructed in 1997 and used as the entrance to the old mansions to be used as a display.
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996.
In the Ogata-kuri style, 16 domestic steam locomotives produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period (16 ryo at the beginning of the opening) are housed and displayed.
At the time of the opening of the opening, two cars of C53 and C51 were registered to 15 cars, but as of 2006, the motorization of the motoration has been carried out several times.
Five cars of the five cars are still registered by the car, and two cars (C571 and C56 C56 machines are used for the trains on the main line such as 'Yamaguchi' and 'Kitabiko' on the Hokuriku Main Line and so on.
Except for these two cars, the trains are not able to run on the Tokaido Main Line because they are not inspected all the taxes.
SL SL Go is also operated on the track of the track within the museum by the pulling of the mobility equipment for the exhibition of the museum in the museum.
This exhibition line used to be located on the north side of the current site (where a restroom and parking facilities were used in the past, but it was moved to the former site of the former Nijo Station building and the south end of the current Umekoji Park was changed to a tramway in the Sagano Line.
Even now, it has a function as an institution and is also connected to the business line.
Furthermore, after the closure of the Takutori factory of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West), the steam locomotive has been improved.
Bai:
It comes from 'Ume' (plum tree) which means Umekoji (Umekoji).
In 1976, all the cars except the C62 cars that were designated as the C62, were designated as quasi-railway monuments along with the carts and conservative engineering tools.
The procedures that do not do special matters are the procedure of transfer from the former organization in 1972.
There is no announcement on the train since the time of the preservation of Umekoji Station.

Shomyo is one of the traditional music in Japan.
It is a religious music that is used for rites and rituals, as a result of the introduction of Buddhist scriptures.
In Japan, it is also called Bonbai or Bonbon.
In the old Japanese style style, it was written as "seimyo."
It is one of the academic fields of ancient India.
Gogyo refers to five kinds of students, Shomyo (study of phonology, grammar and technology), Kokuho (study of technology), Iho (medical science), Inmei (study of the ethics) and Naimei (study of the teachings of the sect), and in the case of Buddhism, it refers to the category of learning of the five kinds of scholars.
Along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, it has been handed down to Japan.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held during the Great Buddha Hall of Todai-ji Temple in 754, and it is believed that Shomyo was actively held during the Nara period.
In the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai handed down their voice and became the base of Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo in the early Heian period.
Various sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect also have their own voices and they have been handed down to the present day.
Shomyo did not have the scores of music because he was told by Kuden (oral instruction).
For this reason, the secrets were extremely difficult.
Later, hakase, which was a musical scoop, was invented.
There are differences in terms of professional terms, such as hakase, depending on the schools.
However, Hakase is a reference to the chanting of Shomyo, and it is necessary to learn Kuden (or Roi), and it is not possible to maintain and inherit the schools from the masters.
For this reason, the training of the leaders and successors was inevitable.
Many schools were abolished due to various conditions.
Tendai Shomyo was based on Saicho, and developed its own development.
After Saicho, Ennin and Anzen flourished.
Ryonin, the founder of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect, is known as the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
In 1109, Ryonin built Raigo-in Temple in Ohara in Kyoto.
The honorific mountain prefix of Raigo-in Temple in Ohara was named Gyosan, which was the birthplace of Chinese Shomyo and was called Mt. Uozan.
Before long, the two temples of Raigo-in and Shorin-in Temple came to be known as the dojo of Mt. Uozan, the Ohara school.
In addition, Jakara later became a member of the school, and in Ohara there was a voices of the two schools of the same lineage.
After that, Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo (Priest Shomyo OHARA).
Tanchi built a flow based on the theory of new music theory.
Since then, the center of Tendai Shomyo has been handed down to the current Tendai Shomyo.
Yuzu Nenbutsu sect and Shomyo of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) are the lineage of Tendai Shomyo.
The Shingonshu Shomyo is based on Kukai, which still remains today.
The reason why Shomyo had been systematized was after Shinga.
Kancho can be said to have been the restorer of the Chuko family.
He worked as a composer and improvements for Shomyo.
There were many schools until the Kamakura period, but it was compiled by the Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho, the four schools of the Honsoin school, the Shingoin style, the Daigo school and the Nakagawa Daishinryu.
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect fell into decline during the Edo period.
It was abolished until the middle of the Meiji period until the middle of the Meiji period.
At present, it is divided into the Shomyo of Mt. Chizan (Chizoku-in Temple in Kyoto) and Buzan (長谷寺) Shomyo (長谷寺) of Mt. Buzen, and the Nanzan-shinryu (Nanzan-ryu, Mt. Koya, Kyoto and Kogi Shingon sect).
Shomyo CHIYAMA and Shomyo TOYOYAMA of the Shingi Shingon sect (Shomyo of the Shingi sect) are derived from the Nakagawa Daishinryu school.
Raiyu adopted the old school of the Daigo school.
When Negoro-ji Temple (Wakayama Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583, the two schools of Chizan and Buzan came to form a new school based on the old schools of Daigo.
It is characterized by being called 'Rongi' in Buzan and 'Shomyo.'
The Nakagawa Daishin school of the Nanzan school (Kogi Shingon sect Shomyo) became its origin.
The Nakagawa Daishin school was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa-dera Temple in Nara.
During the Joei era (1232-1233), Koyasan Rengeidani and Sanbo-in moved their home ground to Mt. Koya.
Later, he called himself Nanzan Shinryu after the name of Mt. Koya.
It is also called Shinryu or Noyama Shinryu school.
It can be said that the sounds such as heikyoku (ballads sung to the accompaniment of a Noh play), Yokyoku (Noh song), Minyo (folk songs) and Joruri (dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment) were changed from Shomyo (voice).
It is largely influenced by a single melody music.
Emperor Tenchi (also known as Emperor Tenji)
A male.
626 - December 3, 672 (January 7, 672)
The thirty-eighth Emperor
His national posthumous name was Ame no Hirakakasuwake, and he was also called Amekawakukawake no Mikoto.
His posthumous name was Kazuraki or Katsuragi.
It is believed that he was called Katsuragi no Miko or Katsuragi no Miko.
It is generally known as Naka no Oe no Oji or Naka no Oe.
The word 'Oe no Oe' means the crown prince and 'Naka no Oe no Oe' means 'the next crown prince.'
Summary
He was the second prince of the Emperor Jomei.
His mother was Princess Takara, who later became Emperor Kogyoku.
The empress was Yamatohime no Okimi, a daughter of Furuhito no Oe no Oenomiko, who was a half older paternal half-brother.
He conspired with NAKATOMI no Kamatari and executed a coup d'etat and killed SOGA no Iruka and his uncle Emperor Kotoku became the crown prince.
And he established the Taika era (Taika Era) and carried out various reforms (Isshi no Hen, the leading figure of the Taika Reforms).
In addition, he was condemned to death by inlaid with his power in a coup d'etat after the Prince Arima and others.
In 660, Baekje was destroyed by the Tang Dynasty and Silla and sent the Prince of Baekje Buyeo Pung who was staying in the Imperial Court back and tried to restore Baekje.
He stayed in Tsukushi to command the rescue of Baekje, but in 661, Empress Saimei passed away.
After that, he did not ascend to the throne for a long time, but after he suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663, he moved the capital to Otsu City and ascended the throne.
After the Battle of Hakusukinoe he established Minaka-jo Castle and Sakimori (defenses) as part of the policy to defend the national land.
In addition, Kani (cap rank) also carried out reforms of the system from the nineteenth to the twenty-sixth ranks.
In addition, in 670, he made the oldest national family register of the country 'Kogo Nensei' (yearly tax registers).
According to the Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan), Emperor Tenchi had the first prince Prince Otomo succeed to the throne.
However, in the Jinshin War which occurred after the death of Emperor Tenchi, his younger brother Oama no Miko (Emperor Tenmu) succeeded to the throne.
After that, the Emperor Shotoku of the lineage of Emperor Tenmu continued to the reign of Emperor Shotoku.
After the death of Emperor Shotoku, Shirakabe no okimi, a grandson of Emperor Tenchi, ascended the throne as Emperor Konin, and after that, it became the line of Emperor Tenchi.
It is said that the four daughters of Prince Oama were sent to Prince Oama as the wife of Prince Oama because Prince Oama recaptured Nukata no Okimi.
History
He was born in 626
On July 12, 645, he became the Crown Prince.
July 24, 661: Shosei
On February 20, 668, he succeeded to the throne.
On January 7, 672, he died at the age of 46.
(According to "Fuso Ryakki" (A Brief History of Japan) he was assassinated by Emperor Tenmu's side because he was said to have died of disease as one theory after the death of a disease in the "Fuso Ryakki" (A Brief History of Japan), there is a theory that he was assassinated by the Emperor Tenmu because he was said to have been killed in the mountain because he had died of illness.
The reason why Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time is one of the mysteries in the political history of the middle of the seventh century.
There are several theories about this theory.
He was in consideration of the power that supported Emperor Tenmu.
In other words, it is wrong that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, and it is based on the theory that he was an older brother of Emperor Tenchi, who was born before the Empress Kogyoku married to the Emperor Jomei and he was an older brother of Emperor Tenchi.
It is certain that the year of Emperor Tenmu was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenchi and some of the history books of "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), and the year of Emperor Tenmu became the mayor of the year after the death of Emperor Tenchi.
However, there is no contradiction between the same historical material, and there are many historical materials that have a gap between 8 and 9 years of age.
On the other hand, there is an opinion that 'even though his father was different from his father, the younger brother who was a younger brother' that he intentionally carried out the age of Tenchi, but the age of 16 was different from the age of his father Emperor Jomei when the Emperor Jomei ascended to the throne.
Therefore, the year of his birth was in 614, which was adopted by the imperial descendant Inin Jounroku (records of the Imperial Family) and so on.
The Emperor Tenchi and Empress Jito who had reigned around the time of the Emperor Tenmu did not ascend to the throne immediately.
It is said that there were differences in errors.
There is a theory that the book is not the same because it is pointed out as "Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)" or "Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)" and the other historical books that have been compiled are not included in the same period.
(See also refer to the article of 'the age of Emperor Tenmu.')
The Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat by Prince Karu (Emperor Kotoku) and there is a theory that Naka no Oe no Oji was ousted from his position.
Recently, the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is comparatively good and it has been pointed out that the basic policy is similar to the basic policy.
When Naka no Oe no Oji killed Iruka.
In addition, the theory was advocated because it was recognized in the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).
In this theory, the Soga clan other than Iruka was not expelled after the coup d'etat by the Emperor Kogyoku, and this theory attracted attention because of the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka had not been expelled even after the coup d'etat.
There is a theory that the enthronement was delayed due to the opposition of the relationship between the women of the Emperor Tenchi.
There is a theory that Emperor Kotoku, who was described in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), suggested the relationship between her and Tenchi in the poem that the Emperor Kotoku was sent to his wife no ma no Himemiko (younger sister of the same mother of the Emperor Tenchi) in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan).
Although her love and marriage between her half brother and a half brother of a different mother, she was not allowed to be forgiven, but according to the love situation between her and her siblings, she was persuaded by her brother Michiko SATO, and she was furious about her relationship with her even after she got married to her uncle, Prince Arima and was reprimanded in the scene where she was reprimanded by the Emperor Kotoku.
After the death of Empress Saimei, Hashihito no Himemiko succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous emperor, but there is a theory that the record was deleted due to some reason.
In "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), there is a theory that the person who was called 'Nakashino no Himemiko' came from the theory that 'Nakahi no Mikoto' was the Emperor who succeeded to the throne until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi.
There is a theory that says that there was a need to be called by the special name of Hashihito no Himemiko, but there is no clear evidence that it is not certain.
Although it is difficult to prove the fact that the political history and historical materials are based on the nature of the political history, the study of the future progresses can be seen as well as the cooperation of archaeological results.

The Saionji family was a court noble who belonged to the Fujiwara clan.
He was a member of the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and his family status was the Seiga family (the second highest family status for court nobles).
The Toin family and the Imadegawa family (the Kikutei family) were divided into the Saionji family.
In addition, the Saionji clan in Iyo Province was a powerful branch family of the Saionji clan who used the family name of Saion-ji Temple.
The crest of the family crest is the left-hand mitsudomoe (mitsumitsudomoe trips).
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane.
When Michisue's great-grandson Kintsune SAIONJI married MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, he was confined to the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) during the Jokyu War as a result of his involvement in the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and he gained power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi (liaison officers between the Imperial Court and the central government) after the war he gained the trust of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
The family name of Saionji comes from the name of the temple which Kintsune built in a villa in Kyoto (Kitaso villa, Kadono County, Yamashiro Province).
This hall was also called Kitayama-dono Palace and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by the Saionji family by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.
He received support from the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) after Kintsune, and also gained power of the Sekke (line of regents and advisers) through the Kamakura period.
Sanekane SAIONJI approached Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) and put his daughter into the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and the Emperor Godaigo.
However, after Kinhira SAIONJI who was his son, the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) came to establish a distance from the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Kameyama) became increasingly opposed to the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama).
After that, when Kinemune SAIONJI died, the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) fell, he was dismissed from the post of Kanto Moshitsugi.
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO (Tokioki) who was the remnant of the Hojo clan, and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration and planned to install the Retired Emperor Go-Fushimi of the Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu) and planned to overthrow the Retired Emperor Go-Fushimi of the Jimyoin line, and Kinmune was arrested and executed.
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, Sanetoshi SAIONJI who was the son of Kinmune served the Northern Court and restored the family name.
He was also known as a family of biwa (Japanese lute) in the Muromachi and Edo periods.
In the early Edo period, Saneharu SAIONJI married Tokuhime who was the eldest son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA (later disinherited) Tadataka HOSOKAWA to the Minister of the Left, but Kyumu NAGAOKA donated 600 koku to the Saionji family in order to pay funds to the Saionji family.
At the end of the Edo period, Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted by the Tokudaiji family of the same Kanin line, and after the Meiji Restoration, he was active as a politician, and he was highly involved in the politics of the Taisho and Showa periods.
It is said that Kinmochi's performance of biwa (Japanese lute) which was the family business of the Saionji family was troubled but he was said to have been a bad play by Emperor Meiji when he was the Prime Minister of the Imperial Household and he was in charge of playing with biwa (Japanese lute) in the Imperial Household Ministry.
Mt. Hiei is a mountain located in the western part of Shiga Prefecture and the northeastern part of Kyoto City, Shiga Prefecture.
It is a generic term for the two peaks of Mt. Hiei (84.3m), which are located on the border between Otsu City and Sakyo Ward, and the two peaks of Mt. Shimei (838 m).
It is located in Otsu City, which is one of the three corners of Hiei.
Mt. Koya has been believed to have been worshipped since ancient times, and the temple flourished with Enryaku-ji Temple and Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine.
It is included in Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).
His other names were Mt. Hiei and Mt. Hiei and Mt. Tendai, and Mt. Taito and Mt. Fuji.
Summary
It is located on the north side of the Kimon gate in Kyoto, and Mt. Hiei was regarded as a mountain to guard the King of China.
According to the Kojiki, Mt. Hiei was written as Mt. Hie, and Oyamakui no kami was enshrined in Mt. Hie in Omi Province and Narukura is believed to be the shintai (object of worship housed in a Shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity) of the shrine.
After Enryaku-ji Temple was opened to Mt. Hie, Oyamakui no kami was believed to be the guardian deity of the Tendai sect and Enryaku-ji Temple, and the Sanno-o belief spread to Oyamakui no kami as a landlord.
In addition, Mt. Hiei is also a mountain of worship, which is a mountain where a thousand days pilgrimage to the main hall of Mt. Hiei and the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine at the foot of the mountain.
Typical climbing is the mountain climb, and there are Unmo-zaka slope that climb from Shugakuin in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City and the climbing path from Mudoji Tani (Sakamoto) to Mudo-ji Tani (Sakamoto, Shiga Prefecture) on the Shiga side.
The Kumomori-zaka slope has been a road that a monk and an imperial messenger from the Imperial Court visited Kyoto and Enryaku-ji Temple from ancient times, and the number of visitors to the climbing is still many today.
The Tokai-Tokai Natural Road runs from Otsu to Ohara in the mountain.
Many tourists visit the station on holidays, because the road is a toll road, a cable car and a loopway to the top of the mountain.
Formerly, there used to be an amusement park of Mt. Hiei and Mt. Hiei, but all of them were closed before 2002 and the site of the site of the Ski Park is located at the site of the museum and the site of the site of the summit is now called 'Gamen Amusement Hiei.'
In the Yase area of the Kyoto side, there was Yunchi MORI's Yutaenchi in the former Yase area, but this was closed on November 30, 2001, and a membership resort was built on the site.
Mt. Hiei and Mt. Shimei
According to the surveys conducted by the Kokuchi Rishin, the top of the east was Obiei and the top of the west was Mt. Hiei as a general term for the general term of the surveys of the country.
In the 'Ten no Ki' (Record of the point), the name of the point of the three triangles located at the top of the east is 'Mt. Hiei.'
This triangle point is located on the border between Otsu City and Kyoto City, but it is located in Otsu City.
When Mt. Hiei is seen from the Kyoto Basin, it is difficult to confirm the top of Mt. Hiei and sometimes Mt. Hiei is the summit of Mt. Hiei.
In the Eizan Ropeway of the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., the station is located on the top of Mt. Hiei by the summit of Mt. Shimyodake.
There are many theories about the name of Mt. Shimei or the pronunciation of the Chinese character "四明岳" or "四明神" in the name of "四明岳," and in 'Kyoto City' it is written as "四明岳" or "四明名名名" in the name of "四明神社" as "四明明神社" in "四明明神社," and in "四明明神社" (pronounced "四明神社" in "四明明明神社" in Chinese characters and "四明神社" in "四明神社" in "四明明神社" (pronounced "四明神社" in Japanese).
The names of Mt. Tendai and Mt. Hiei are derived from the fact that Mt. Hiei is another name of Mt. Hiei and Mt. Shimei in the People's Republic of China which is related to the Tendai sect.

"Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) is a essay written by Sei Shonagon, a female writer in the middle of the Heian period.
It is also written as "Makura Zoshi" or "Makura no makusoshi," and it is said that in the case of the makie (Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder) of the Maeda manuscript in the Kamakura period there is a description that "Seishonagon no soshi" (the Pillow of Sei Shonagon) is the oldest makie (Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder) of the Maeda manuscript in the Kamakura period.
It is also called "Seishonagon-ki" (diary of Sei Shonagon).
He had a great influence on later renga (linked verse), haikai (seventeen-syllable verse), and kana zoshi (illustrated books) in the "Tale of Genji."
Along with "Hojoki" by KAMO no Chomei and "Tsurezuregusa" written by Kenko YOSHIDA, he was called the three great history and satire in Japan.
It has been pointed out that the similarity of "Giyamazanzasan" written by Li Shan (Xuan Zan), which was compiled in the late Tang period, is not seen in the books of the book.
According to the postscript written at the end of the book, when FUJIWARA no Korechika, the Minister of the Center, presented a paper that was expensive at the time of the time of the Emperor Ichijo, he replied that the emperor had been in charge of writing was a nomakura, and Sei Shonagon, who was asked by the Imperial Household to write it as 'if it is true.'
It is based on the fact that he was given a paper from the Imperial Palace (according to the three volumes, it was not included in the Noin bon manuscript 'Makuramakura no makurame' and the 'makurabaya' of Noinbon manuscript in the 'Sakaibon' and the 'Maedabaya' of the 'Sakai-bon manuscript').
It is commonly believed that the name of "Makura no soshi" comes from this.
According to "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) written by Kazuhiko HAYASHI, there are researchers such as Keichu ORIGUCHI and Kikan IKEDA in the past.
The following is a representative explanation about the meaning of makurakami.
Nezu-gusetsu: The word 'Shiki-makuma' in which the word 'Shiki' is based on the verb of 'Shiki-ki' (historical record) and 'Shiki-dan' (wrapping cloth)
The theory of writer: There are many chapters of Utamakura (Utamakura), Shintokutoku, and terms because many chapters are included in this category.
Bibyoku-setsu: The meaning of Zoshi that should be kept in the pillow as Bibyoku-roku
The theory of the treasured book
The theory of unrelated relationship
However, there is still no accepted theory.
In addition, 'Makura no soshi' as a common noun was used as a common noun in "Eiga Monogatari" (The Tale of Flowering Fortunes).
The first draft was written in the postscript and around 996, which was written by the author MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa, who had been appointed to the position of Sachujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and spread to the world.
There is also a sentence which is thought to have been written around the end of the Kanko era that was written after that.
In the text of "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) written in the old commentary of "The Tale of Genji" of the Tale of Genji, there is no extant manuscript in the text of "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book), which makes it difficult to think of the complicated process of the process of composition.
The differences between Denpon and Denpon are very large.
It consists of three volumes.
There are various books which were written in 1228 by FUJIWARA no Sadaie who was a person who was thought to be the head of the Imperial family.
It is easy to understand that it is easy to read, and it is considered to be the closest to the ancient style.
In addition, Kikan IKEDA distinguished it into two types.
The first volume of the book: 70 episodes starting at the beginning of the chapter such as 'Haru no Akebono' fell off and began to be handed down from 'This is the origin of the book.'
It is a story of 230 stories.
The Yomei Bunko Library, the collection of the books owned by the Imperial Household Archives and Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency, and the book owned by the Takamatsunomiya family
The second volume (O-category group): 300 stories
The former property owned by Mao YATOMI and owned by the Kariya Library, the former property owned by the Date family, the old collection of the Kajuji family, the former collection of the Kaju-ji Temple, the former collection of the Nakason manuscript and the manuscript owned by the Kodo Bunko Library.
It is said that Noin Hoshi, who was a relative of Sei Shonagon, was related to the tradition of Sei Shonagon's biological son, TACHIBANA no Norinaga, who was a daughter of Sei Shonagon.
It dates back to the end of the Kamakura period.
It is almost an established theory that the origin of the Noin bon bon manuscript is almost inferior to the conclusion of the three volumes of the book.
There are 230 stories except for the seventy-seven stories.
300 books
It is a triumphant form.
A book handed down in the Muromachi period.
The name of the Sakai-bon manuscript has been written by KIYOHARA no Ekata, who lived in Sakai City, because it is written that the manuscript owned by a monk Doga was copied by KIYOHARA no Shiekata.
It consists of two volumes.
It is missing from the diaries and the reception.
Gokogonin bon - 190 stories
There is a description that Emperor Gokogon was copied by Emperor Gokogon.
Shinkan bon
It is a collection of 95 tales.
There are two kinds of the above mentioned above.
Generally speaking, Sakai bon refers to this.
1 volume 107
It is a second volume and eighty-nine stories.
It consists of three volumes and 102.
It is a four-story stories.
The fifth volume was lost
It is a triumphant form.
There are only books handed down from the Maeda family in Kaga Province and the Maeda family (owned by the Maeda Ikutokukai group).
In the box of gold makie (Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder), it is described as "Seishonagon no soshi" (the Pillow of Sei Shonagon) with gold inlaid pattern.
It is an important cultural property.
It is said to be the oldest transcription of "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book) in the early Kamakura period.
Among them, the Gokogon edition of the Sakai main line was divided into two parts: "Gunsho ruiju" (Collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi HANAWA), and the third volume of the Sakaibon manuscript was included in "Shin Gunshoruiju ruiju" (New Collection of Japanese Classified Documents).
Since Noin bon was used as the original text for the old type printing edition in the early Edo period (Kanei era), it became a set of commentaries such as "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) and "Makura no Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) (annotated from Suigin KITAMURA).
However, in 1946, Jutaro TANAKA (1917-1987) reevaluated the second version of the third volume edition and after the Second World War the book was adopted as a textbook.
In addition, it is considered to have been written in three volumes in the text of the kotobagaki (words written in the Heian period), and the seven chapters of "Makura no Soshi Ekotoba" (picture scrolls of the Pillow Book) written in the late Kamakura period still exist today.
The second edition of the third volume has more than 300 chapters.
There are many kinds of sentences such as 'insects and flowers of trees, such as 'Ruiju-shudan' and 'utsukushikimono,' and 'zuiusodan' which observes the nature of everyday life and the nature of the season, 'zuiusodan' (essay), which was written by the author of the author and 'Kaidan-niki' (Diaries of the Imperial Court) in which the Imperial Court was returned to the court society in the vicinity of the Empress Teishi/Teishi, and so on.
However, there is an ambiguation chapter for classifications; for example, in the first section "Haru Akebon," there is an opinion that it is a different chapter in the popular opinion.)
Although it is written in a simple style of Japanese style using hiragana (hiragana character), it is generally written in a simple style of Japanese style and has many short-short writings, reflecting the downfall of the Chancellor family and the Empress Teishi's misfortune, and there are some emotional emotions that have been spoken during the time of the time when it was in touch with an emotion.
The sophisticated sensus of the author and the sharp observation of things were combined with the 'Mono aware' of the "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji), which made the world of aesthetics and the beauty of 'washikashi' (wisteria in the world of the world) to express the emotional emotional emotions of "The Tale of Genji."
positive evaluation
Since Makura no Soshi was deeply loved by humans and nature, they were created and formed as the beauty of various kinds of trends.
In the chapters of each chapter which is repeated next to the next generation, there is no distinction between the thought, the love and the receptions of each chapter, and it has a rich material in the sky, which is expressed by its own expression.
The expression of 'season' (Xuan) is a new expression of 'season' (Shun) in the "Kokinshu" (the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), which is a kind of 'spring, Hanao' (Hana)' seen in the "Kokinshu (Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) at that time, and it is a way to challenge the beauty of the reader who was familiar with waka traditional, and it is a new expression of the Ministry of State (Toshimoto FUJIMOTO).
She appears in the deep love of the chugu Teishi.
It was written in the midst of the misfortunes that Michitaka family declined, in order to calm Teishi's soul.
Therefore, there is no description about the decline of the Michitaka family (same as above).
The chapter of which is seen in the personal tales, says that even when the Empress and the chugu were lost in the era of the Emperor, they insisted that they would live in the world of loving with the Emperor's favors of the Emperor (Uenokuri).
criticism
Even though he forgot the rank of Sei Shonagon (lesser councilor of state) and tried to join the upper class (Kenzan AKIYAMA).
(There is no respect to those who are not in the status of their own relatives, not only those with high social status but also those with high social status are not respected.)
It is not written by the qualification of 'individual' in the 'Record of civilization of the kokyu (empress's residence), but it is not written by the qualifications of 'individual' (Takeji ISHIDA).

After Emperor Meiji returned to the political power (Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), he aimed to unite Kobu-gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate), but in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi after the Restoration of Imperial Rule, he returned to Edo-jo Castle and was ordered by the Imperial Court to hunt down and kill the Tokugawa shogunate, and he was allowed to surrender the Edo-jo Castle without the surrender of Edo-jo Castle.
In the Meiji period, when he was released from house arrest, he was devoted to his hobbies and lived until the Taisho period as a duke.
Yoshinobu' is also read as 'Yoshinobu' or 'Keiki' (pronounced as 'Yoshinobu' in Japanese).
There is a record that the official document of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was read as "Yoshihisa."
His name is also written in the Albuct and the English Newspaper that he himself himself wrote 'Yosiaa'.
In Mito City, where he was born, he is often called 'Yoshinobu,' but in Shizuoka City, where he spent the rest of his life, he is often called 'Keiki' in many cases.
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu during his lifetime, Yoshinobu was fond of being called 'Keiki-sama' and he also called himself 'Keiki' in telegraph that he was given to his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA who succeeded Yoshinobu was also called 'Keikyu sama' by people around the same time as Yoshinobu.
There are two names of 'Keiki-sa' and 'Keiki-san' and it is considered that the name of 'Keiki-san' is often found in various places not only in Shizuoka but also in both cases it is often used as "very close association."
Ryotaro SHIBA said that 'many people called "Keiki" were from the family line of former retainers of the shogun, but there is a possibility that they were hidden in a wide area because even people of the Higo Domain who had moved to overthrow the Shogunate.
On September 29, 1837, he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the ninth lord of Mito Domain in Koishikawa, Edo.
His mother was the Shogun who was the biological mother of the legal wife Yoshiko (Princess Yoshiko (Yoshiko) who was the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Iemitsu's real mother was Oe no kata, who was the legal wife of her father, Hidetada, but there is a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was her real mother.
His childhood name was Shichiromaro.
In accordance with the educational policy of Nariaki, he moved to the Mito Domain seven months after his birth, and during the time when he succeeded to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, he became a professor of studies and martial arts from the study of studies and martial arts in the same place.
It seems that Yoshinobu was attracted to attention at that time, and at first Nariaki thought that he did not adopt his adopted son to other families and he thought that he would remain in his hand as a hasty for his eldest son (legitimate son) and Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA.
On August 1, 1847, the bakufu ordered the Mito Domain to inherit Shichiromaro as the heir to the Hitotsubashi family of Gosankyo (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).
In response to this, Shichiromaro succeeded to the Hitotsubashi family on September 1, and in December he was given a portion of the name of a portion of the name of a portion of the name of a portion of the name of the first shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.
Ieyoshi often visited the residence of the Hitotsubashi family and thought that Yoshinobu was a powerful candidate for the successor of the shogun, but he abandoned the plan because he was remonstrated by Masahiro ABE who was a roju (member of shogun's council of elders).
In 1853, during the turmoil of the arrival of the Black Ships, Shogun Ieyoshi died of disease and Iesada TOKUGAWA, the 13th shogun, did not have a son because he was in poor health and did not have a son, so there was an issue of a problem that 'there was an heir to the Shogun.'
The Hitotsubashi group led by Nariaki ABE, Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU, the lord of the domain of the Satsuma Domain, Naosuke II who recommended Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Hikone Domain and the real mother of Iesada and Honjuin opposed the Nanki group of the Nanki school of O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants resided).
The Hitotsubashi group tried to make Tenshoin, an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU as the shogun's wife and sent them to O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside), but after the death of Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died in 1858, Naosuke II, who became Tairo (chief minister) decided to decide that the successor of the Shogun was Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA.'
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu, together with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA, the lord of the Fukui domain of Fukui and others, asked Naosuke, but he was sentenced to retirement in 1859 (Ansei no Taigoku).
Although Yoshinobu was not aware of the fact that he would become the heir of the shogun, he sent a letter to Nariaki that he would not be able to do anything because he failed due to his failure.
In 1860, he was suspended from house arrest.
In 1862, an imperial envoy Shigetomi OHARA and a member of the Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU entered Edo and the Emperor Komei ordered him to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as Shogun-kokenshoku (guardian) and Shungaku MATSUDAIRA (Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA) as Tairo (chief minister).'
On July 6, the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as Shogun-kokenshoku (guardian) and Shungaku as the president of political affairs.
Yoshinobu and Shungaku tried to reform the shogunate government called the Bunkyu Reforms (Bunkyu Reform) and relied on the Kyoto shugoshoku and the Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In 1863, he went to Kyoto as a pioneer of the Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court who was on the way to expel foreigners.
When the Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners, Iemochi was forced to have an audience with Iemochi in hasty because he had no choice but to carry out the expulsion of foreigners when he received a setto (a sword made by the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners).
When the supporters of the Sonno-joi-ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) led by the Choshu clan were rejected in the Coup of August 18, he went to Kyoto again to participate in the council of the Kobu-gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate) and the Sabaku-ha (supporters of the shogunate).
However, it can be said that he was not able to take part in the meeting and negotiate with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko at a drinking party with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko, and he abused Munenari DATE, Shungaku MATSUDAIRA and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU at his residence and also NAKAGAWA said, 'Shimazu,' and he could not take advantage of the collapse of the system.
After that, he stayed in Kyoto and was appointed to the governor of Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (Governor-General of the Imperial Palace) of the Imperial Court, and together with Katamori MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Aizu clan) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Kuwana domain), he controlled the Imperial loyalists and court nobles (Ichikai-hashi, Aizu and Kuwana Domain).
In the Tenguto no Ran (Rebellion of Tenguto), Kounsai TAKEDA and other vassals of the Mito Domain who supported Yoshinobu, cut down and showed his coolness.
In 1864, he took command of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in the Kinmon Incident and attacked the Choshu army which occupied the Takatsukasa residence.
When the First Expedition of the Choshu Conquest was over, he worked hard in the imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without imperial sanction, and succeeded in obtaining an imperial sanction on condition that he would have received an imperial sanction.
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu was ordered to make an imperial order for the conquest of Choshu.
However, the bakufu refused to dispatch troops to the Satsuma Domain which formed the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance, and the bakufu was defeated.
On July 20, during the Second conquest of Choshu, Shogun Iemochi died in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu made an imperial rescript to the Imperial Court and succeeded in the conclusion of the suspensory agreement.
Although he was recommended as the successor of Ieshige, Yoshinobu firmly refused this.
Although the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of Shogun on August 20, the Shogun family continued to reject the assumption of the Shogun.
After that, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) and other members asked him to become shogun, but on December 5, he was appointed as Shogun by the order of the Emperor Komei.
In other words, he was promoted to the shogun by selling his gratitude and tried to make the government more advantageous in politics.
Yoshinobu received the help of 20,000 dollars from France through the French Minister Léon Léon LES, and established Yokosuka Tekisho, building and shipbuilding and invited military advisors such as Julius and Buef.
He also encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Europe for his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA in the Paris World Exposition as a shogun's retainer.
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port, the Imperial Court strongly insisted on the Imperial Court and received an imperial sanction.
On October 14, 1867, Yoshinobu was predicted to the Satsuma-Choshu Domain to resist the 'secret imperial order to overthrow the Shogun' (Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor), and on the next day, he received an imperial sanction to the Imperial Court for the return of the government to the Emperor.
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time judged that there was no administrative ability and sought to survive the Tokugawa government under the leadership of the council of feudal lords.
However, the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued by Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA, who was aiming to overthrow the Shogunate, and Yoshinobu ordered 'Jikan-nochi (resignation of the Minister of the Interior) and 'Jikan-no' (dedication of the territory of the Tokugawa clan) in December of the same year.
Yoshinobu left Osaka Castle in order to avoid conflicts, and he gathered foreign ministers and also made the Imperial Court to change the Jikan Nos.
However, in the following year, 1868, the Satsuma Domain raised an army in the city of Edo, and the Satsuma Domain used the Aizu Domain and Kuwana Domain's soldiers to retreat to Kyoto.
However, in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi which broke out on January 3, the former bakufu army was disadvantageous and he withdrew to Edo in the military appraiser "Kayoyomaru."
Soon after that, the order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu as the Emperor's enemy, and the government army led by Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started the expedition to the east.
Yoshinobu tried to suppress the resistance faction led by Tadayori OGURI and insisted on obedience.
In February, he was appointed to the post of Kaishu KATSU and himself confined to his house in Daiji-in Kanei-ji Temple in Ueno.
He also handed over the headship of the Tokugawa family to his adopted son, Kamenosuke TAYASU, (later Iesato TOKUGAWA).
After the negotiation with Katsu and Takamori SAIGO of the Imperial army, the Edo-jo Castle was bloodshed and Yoshinobu was transferred to Mito, and he was confined to his house in the room of Kodokan (a domain school) of the hanko (domain school).
In July, he moved to Sunpu where the Tokugawa family was transferred to the Tokugawa family.

When his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA was in sleeping as a problem when the Tokugawa family succeeded to the Tokugawa family, he had a shave of a sword in his pillow when he was sleeping in order to correct his bedside (it is just a threat, and it is said that he saw the shave of the shave of the sword in his sleep).
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he was in sleeping after his adulthood, he was said to be the two of his wife and his mistresses in the same way as Yu.
Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph in his childhood, but it is doubtful that he was not in Japan because he was still a photograph in his childhood.
It is said that at that time he visited Iemochi's visit to see Ieshige's illness when he was ill.
He was known for his bravery, and Tatewaki AJIMA, who was the belly of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, criticized Yoshinobu as 'Kiyomen Men Men no Onihito,' and he was praised as 'Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.'
Yoshinobu was known about to overthrow the Shogunate, and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu Domain said, 'There is no traitor of Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI.'
Ieyasu was cautious about him saying, 'It seems to have come back again.'
In response to the resolution of Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), Ryoma SAKAMOTO said, 'It is a great tree (Shogun), and this is the true state of the present day.
Even though he was very skilled in secrecy, he often refused to pay his salary.
He gave an opinion that 'he would abandon his life for the public and tried to give Yoshinobu the position of vice chief adviser to the Emperor of the new government.'
However, it was after the Meiji period when Yoshinobu came to know the existence of Ryoma (after the death of Ryoma).
He was not limited to Yoshinobu but Ryoma's acquaintance during his lifetime was very low compared to that of the Meiji Restoration.
In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he was greatly criticized by his side by saying that he ran back to Edo after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi.
At that time, the gold seal of the gold fan had been forgotten, but there were some people who ridiculously ridiculously ridiculled with Yoshinobu's beloved concubine, who had been in love with her.
However, there is a theory that it was necessary to resist the armed uprising in Edo and Musashi Provinces at that time and because Yoshinobu became the enemy of the Imperial Court, it was necessary to avoid the intervention of foreign countries because it was inevitable to avoid the intervention of foreign countries.
He was considered to be an enemy of the Imperial Court or because he was confined to Kanei-ji Temple due to the fact that he was in confinement at the Imperial Court, and he was highly evaluated as a person who valued the Emperor and the Imperial Court (according to Mitogaku (the thought of reverence for the Emperor and the fact that his mother was from the Imperial Family), but he was said to be a 'weak age.'
Due to the surrender of the new government and the surrender of the bloodless surrender of Edo without blood, it was highly evaluated that the independence of Japan in modern times was protected by the fact that Japan was close to the unbroken revolution and contributed to the restoration of the Meiji Restoration.
Eichi SHIBUSAWA, a businessman, was a retainer of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family and had a close relationship with him after the Meiji Restoration.
Shibusawa tried to compile the biography of Yoshinobu in his later years, and opened a 'Yumekae' in order to persuade Yoshinobu who was astringent and listen to Naoyoshi.
The book summarizes the story of "Mekukai hiki" (biography of Dreams).
In the chapter which is recorded in a part of the meeting, it can be said that he was an old man who was in the position of Yoshinobu.
At the time of his death, Hisamitsu was not fond of the talking about what he was at the age of time, and he seemed to think of his nature and emotions at that time that he was in the same way he could not like Hisamitsu SHIMAZU' and 'Naomasa NABEBEBESHIMA was a man who was not a man who was not fond of this.'
It was "Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA's Ko-den" (biography of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA) after the death of Yoshinobu based on these historical materials.
When he was pardoned, Yoshinobu made a will to express his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji, who was the highest rank of the kazoku class, to express his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji who was given the title of duke, instead of the Buddhist rites.
For this reason, the grave of Yoshinobu was not in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family and a round barrow, which was the same as that of the Imperial family in the Yanaka Cemetery.
This was because the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was impressed by the fact that the mausoleum of Emperor Komei ("Tokugawa Yoshinobu Konden").
When the roju Katsukiyo ITAKURA, a member of the Roju at the time, said that he would not give up his life to the former retainers of the former shogun who had offered to his own life, he regretted that he would like to do with Yoshinobu.
Although he had a weak image in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and so on in the 'enemy fleet' of the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he has recently been reevaluated due to the fact that he built a new modern political system after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), and there are some movements such as the NHK Taiga Drama by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA.
He was fond of pork in Satsuma Domain like his father, Nariaki, and he was called "buichi no hashi" (Hitotsubashi style).
In his later years, he was interested in Western literary works and was fond of bread and milk, and he sometimes learned French from Amane NISHI (keeper) during the time of the Shogun when he developed his hobbies such as photograph and caution by cameras as well as a hobby of his hobby.
It is famous as a camera man, but it seems that the technique of cameraman was not considered.
It is said that he often wrote the photographic magazine, but he did not adopt it.
The great-grandson of Yoshitomo TOKUGAWA was also a cameraman of Friday, and the photograph owned by the Yoshinobu family was discovered by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA and published in the process of organizing and editing.
His younger brother was Akitake TOKUGAWA who was the younger brother of this hobby.
On December 3, 1859, she married Yoshiko ICHIJO (after the Meiji Restoration, she changed her name to Yoshiko MIGA).
She was born on July 16, 1859 when she was born between her daughter (Keikoinden no ike no ike Pond and a daughter of Odo no ike) was born, but she died young on July 20.
Since then, she did not have a child, and the tenth daughter who was born in the Meiji period had a child with two concubines.
The seventh son Keihisa who became a prince and became the successor of the Yoshinobu family and the tenth son of Kaishu KATSU who became the husband of the adopted daughter of Prince Hiroyasu and the ninth daughter Tsuneko, who became the wife of Prince Fushiminomiya Hiroyasu and became the wife of Prince Fushiminomiya Hiroyo.
The children of Yoshihisa, such as the Princess Kikuko, who was the wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito TAKAMATSU and became the wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito TAKAMATSU and the Princess Kikuko, who became the wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito.
His lawful wife was Yoshiko ICHIJO (changed to Yoshiko MIGA) (after the Meiji Restoration, he was adopted by Kinhisa IMADEGAWA and adopted by Tadaka ICHIJO on July 19, 1836 - July 9, 1897).

Note:
Nara Line is a railway line operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) from Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture to Kyoto Station in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
The entire line is included in the section around the metropolitan area of the city.
Because the line has a history as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line, the official starting point is Kizu Station, but the trains that go from Kyoto to Kizu are operated by the same number as the inbound train number.
Except for the databa, it is described in the direction from Kyoto to Kizu in the following way:
It is said that the color of the line is a brown color, and the reason why the selection is said to be the image of the occurrence of the two old capitals.'
Jurisdiction (type of business): West Japan Railway Company (JR West) (railway operator)
Route distance (operating kilometers): 34.7 km
Track gauge: 1067 mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the starting and final station)
Double-tracked section: between Nitta Station and Uji Station, between JR Fujinomori Station and Kyoto Station
Electrified section: entire line electrified (direct current 1500V)
Block (railway): Automatic block system (multi-track section) and automatic block system (single-track section)
Safety device: Automatic Train Stop
Operation Control Center : Shin-Osaka General Control Center
Maximum speed: 110 km/h (quadruple-track) and 95 km/h (single-track section)
Except for Kizu Station, the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West), which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) West Japan Railway Company (JR West) and the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) is managed by Kizu Station.
The line between Kyoto and Kizu is named as the Nara Line, but the entire section is located in Kyoto Prefecture and there are no routes in Nara Prefecture.
Although the Nara Railway was originally constructed by Nara Railway, it was separated from the Osaka - Nagoya section after the Kansai Railway Company was merged into a part of the line between Osaka and Nagoya.
However, trains are operated from Kizu Station to Nara Station in Nara Prefecture by way of the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line).
JR West established the nickname for the lines of the Urban Network on March 13, 1988, but the Nara Line was sent to the view of the Nara Line.
Because Kintetsu Nara Line is located on the Kintetsu Nara Line, it is sometimes referred to as 'JR Nara Line.'
In the era of Japan National Railways (JNR) when Japan National Railways (JNR) was used, the name of the name of the station was also used as the name of 'JNR Nara Line.'
The Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara and the JR Nara Line, and the Kintetsu Nara Line is the Kintetsu Kyoto Line that is in rivalry with the JR Nara Line.
While many trains of the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel, the Nara Line had not been electrified until 1984 at the end of the JNR era, and only a small type of local trains run on the JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 105 until the privatization of JNR.
However, after the inauguration of JR West, the line was incorporated into the Urban Network and the number of rapid trains such as the 'Miyakoji Rapid train' was rapidly improved rapidly.
At present, the characteristics of tourism and other tourist spots, such as Byodo-in Temple in Uji City along the line, have become more popular as a commuting route and a school line from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Joyo City in Kyoto Prefecture.
However, it has a large detourment to the east of the Momoyama - Shinden section, and in the south of Joyo there is a gap between Keina and local transportation in parallel with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line running outside the central part of the town.
The rolling stock is used for the Nara Train Depot of Osaka Branch but the facilities of the stations are managed by the Kyoto branch except for Kizu Station.
The J-Thru ICOCA and the East Japan Railway Company (JR East), Suica of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and TOICA of the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Tokai) Railway Company (JR Central) (JR Central), and PiTaPa of Surutto KANSAI can be used at all stations at this station.
In the south of Joyo Station the simple ticket gate is also used as a congestion for unmanned stations in the vicinity of Joyo Station.
Since the Express 'Kuroshi (train)' that connected between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station via the Nara Line and the Wakayama Line was abolished in 1984, only local trains were operated until 1991 (some limited express trains were operated for a certain period like limited express train), but now four types of local trains are operated between Miyakoji Rapid trains, Rapid trains, rapid trains, rapid trains, rapid trains, rapid trains, rapid trains, and local trains.
It is the fastest type of the Nara Line, and is mainly operated in the daytime mainly during the daytime.
Basically, the train connects with local trains at Uji Station with the local train at 30-minute intervals.
The nickname of 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' was decided by the public before the operation started.
Many tourists use not only Japanese people but also Japanese tourists, which are sightseeing spots between Kyoto and Nara as well as Japanese tourists.
The rolling stock of all trains of the JR (West) Suburban Train Series 221 is a four-car train or six-car train.
The maximum speed in the double-track section is 110 km/h, and other trains are 95 km/h.
Approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto to Nara, and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Kyoto are required for the standard time.
The train bound for Kyoto is about two minutes on the way to Kyoto or two minutes on the way to Tanakura Station, and there are some differences between the inbound and outbound trains because it is different from the Nara-Miyakoji Rapid train.
For the three days of the New Year, the train stops at Inari Station in order to make a pilgrimage to Fushimi Inari Station.
History
March 3, 2001: Operation of operation started.
March 15, 2003: Due to the timetable revision, the trains began to stop at Tofukuji Station and Tamamizu Station.
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours.
It also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture) where the 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' stopped.
The rolling stock of all trains is operated on the Series 221 and four-car trains are operated with six-car trains.
Basically, the train connects with local trains at Uji Station with the local train at 30-minute intervals.
Similar to the Miyakoji Rapid Service as well as the rapid trains of the Yamatoji Line stop at Hirayama Station.
The stations until March 2001 when the 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' came to be used were in Kyoto, Uji and Joyo (in the beginning), and JNR 117 series were used in Kyoto and Nara, but the Nara Line has not been used since then.
There are some trains that directly connect to the Yamatoji Line in the morning and evening.
It is operated mainly in the morning and night.
At first, only weekday trains were operated on weekdays, but after the timetable revision made on March 18, 2006, the operation was also operated on Saturdays and holidays on Saturdays and holidays.
Although the section between Uji Station and Nara Station stops at every station, there was a regional rapid train bound for Kizu at Uji Station in the middle of the night, but at present, the timetable was changed to a train that ran in front of the regional rapid train.
There are some trains that use JNR 103 series from Kyoto at 20:21 on Saturdays and holidays, and all trains are operated on the JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 21.
During the morning rush hour there are some trains that directly connect to the Yamatoji Line due to the fact that they are operated during the morning rush hours.
As the regional rapid train on the Nara Line tried to prevent the regional rapid trains from regional rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line, the rollsign of regional rapid trains was used as a color due to the revision of the timetable revision in March 2008.
In the section of the station in the north of Kamitakoma Station, it is described in the muraji characters in the murals of the station.
It is operated between Kyoto and Uji, Joyo and Nara.
During the daytime the line between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station runs between Kyoto Station and 15-minute intervals, but between Joyo Station and Kizu Station the interval between Joyo and Kizu is about 30 minutes.
The rolling stock is basically operated on the train series 103 but some of them are operated in the 221 series in some areas.
There are some trains that directly connect to the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late in the late morning.
In the past, there was a direct train to the Sakurai Line, but on September 4, 1994, the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided.
Although it was a special train, limited express trains were sometimes operated on the Nara Line.
From 1987 to 1988, the nickname 'Kuroshi (train)' was used between 1988 and 1989 by JNR 381 series and between Kyoto Station and Hakuhama Station on the Kansai Main Line, Kansai Main Line, Hanwa Line and the Hanwa Line of the Kansai Main Line via the Kansai Main Line and the Hanwa Line.
In the Kinki edition of the Yomiuri Newspaper on January 6, 1998, there was an announcement that limited express trains would run on the Nara Line (using the 381 series as a regular train), but the plan was cancelled after that.
Although there was a period when it was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station (between Kyoto and Naraji Rapid Service) as a Miyakoji Leisure for Miyakoji Route, no direct trains to the Sakurai Line are not operated at present.
In the middle of August, the Uji-gawa River Fireworks Festival was held at the nearest station to Uji Station, but because the trains could not secure transportation capacity, all local trains between Kyoto and Uji were operated only at 16:00 and after 16:00.
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station.
At the time of the single track, the train schedule became a complete holiday and rapid trains began to stop between Kyoto Station and Uji Station, while the number of trains was increased to increase the number of trains until Uji Station.
Depending on the year, there were some trains that turned back at Momoyama Station.
Around 1992, direct trains to the Sakurai Line were extended mainly on Saturdays and holidays and were operated only one hour to Tenri Station.
In addition to the above, there are cases where special trains that are exclusively operated from Japan have been provided.
Especially in the Tenrikyo Taisai Festival held on October 26 every year, the trains called 'Tenri Traffic Train' are operated only from Kyoto Station to Kizu Station on the Nara Line and from Nara Station to Nara Station via the Sakurai Line via the Sakurai Line.
All trains belong to the Nara Train Depot.
JR (West) Suburban Train Series 221
It is common to use the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line, and there are two cars and six cars.
It is mainly operated by four-car sets or six-car trains in the 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' and 'Rapid trains,' but four-car trains are mainly operated on the Nara Line while four-car trains are operated on the Nara Line.
Two sets of two-car sets are found in a holiday schedule.
JNR 103
The type 103 cars used for local trains on the Nara Line are used not only for the Nara Line, but also for the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Rapid trains during rush hours.
Some cars of the Osaka Loop Line are replaced by the transfer cars from the Morinomiya Train Depot.

Keiji Bypass (also known as Keiji Bypass or Keiji Bypass is a bypass of the National Highway Route from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture.
It has been designated as a project for the regional high-standard artisans.
The following is about the Keiji Bypass of the National Highway Route No. 1 and the Keiji Bypass of National Route 24 as follows.
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway and the city of Otsu City and connects with the Kurikoto Interchange of Nagoya City, the Suita Interchange and the Osaka City area.
The Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama Yodo Interchange are National Highway Route No. 1 and National Route 478, and the Kumiyama Yodo Interchange and the Oyamazaki Junction, based on National Highway Route designated by the National Transportation Bureau of National Highway 48, are high-standard high-standard artarterial roads (exclusive for the National Highway Route No. 478 and National Highway 2 of the National Highway Route for the National Highway 2 of the National Highway Route for the National Highway Route for National Highway Route in the direction of National Highway 48, and the Oyamazaki Interchange is the National Highway Route of National Highway 2 and the National Highway Route of the Oyamazaki Interchange is the National Highway Route of National Highway Route which is designated as the National Highway Route for National Highway 2 and the National Highway Route of the National Route of the National Highway Route of National Highway 48.
In the later plan, the Kyoto Daini-kyo Bypass connecting the Kyoto Tanba Road and the Keiji Bypass, which had been the National Highway Route as well as the need to alleviate the traffic congestion of the Meishin Expressway, and the construction of roads in Kyoto City.
The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway have been designated National Route 478 and the improvement of the road has been continued.
It is said that the Keiji Bypass is a Keiji Bypass at the Seta Junction, which is easy to divide the users of the route, and is the Keiji Bypass in the Oyamazaki Junction.
Also, the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass have no difference between the tolls and the ETC discount system.
Here, when there is no special record, the Keiji Bypass (from the Seta Higashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki JCT) as the name of a business route is mentioned here.
Origin: Seta Oe Town, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture
Finance: Oyamazaki-cho, Otokuni-gun, Kyoto Prefecture
The total length is 18.9 km.
Four lanes
The maximum speed is 80 km per hour.

The Uji Tunnel of this line is the longest 4,313 meters among National Highway Route No. 1, and the tunnels are forbidden to change the lines except for the Uji Higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange.
In the vicinity of the Kumiyama Junction, the film "THE EVEVENCI!" was filmed before the opening of the movie.
The distance between the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT, is shorter than the Meishin Expressway, and when the Keiji Bypass runs slightly more than the maximum speed of the Keiji Bypass via Keiji Bypass.
In addition, the Meishin Expressway is often crowded because there are no rest facilities such as the Service Area, and the rest of the Meishin Expressway, the Seta Higashi - Oyamazaki section is the Otsu Rest Area, and the Katsura Rest Areas are located there are two locations.)
However, the structure of Seta and Oyamazaki JCT, which was established after the name of the god, was established after the name of the god (particularly the structure of Oyamazaki Junction).
In the case of going to the direction of Suita and Osaka from the Oyamazaki JC, there is an indispensable point that it is sometimes deleted by merging with the left route of Meishin Expressway.
On the way, the curve and slope path continued, and because many of them are close to them, it does not function as a bypass for Meishin Expressway Expressway.
Because this road is a bypass of National Route 1 (general National Road), this road is not a national highway but not a national highway but a national highway is not a national route.
In the case of the Keiji Bypass, from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka.
This is because the Uji-higashi Interchange is the Hafur Interchange.
For this reason, the section between the Uji Higashi Interchange and the Uji Nishi Interchange is often congested.
Because this general road section is an incomplete section of the VSC, it is difficult to avoid the traffic congestion.

Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Shinshu sect, one of the Jodo Shinshu sect, and is the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) along with Nishi Hongan-ji Temple (the head temple of the Hongan-ji school of the Jodo Shinshu sect).
The official temple's name was 'Hongan-ji Temple' until 1987, and after the same year, it was called 'Shinshu Honbyo Mausoleum.'
In order to distinguish it from Nishi Hongan-ji Temple in the same Shimogyo Ward it is often called 'Higashi san.'
(For more information, refer to the article on the history of Hongan-ji Temple before the split into the east and west sides).
When the twelfth head priest of Hongan-ji Temple Kyonyo (光寿) was given the temple estate to the east of Hongan-ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA in 1602, Kyonyo opened in 1602.
It is located in the present Karasuma Shichijo, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, and is located in the east side of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, which is located in Horikawa-Shichijo, so it came to be called Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.
In 1987, Hongan-ji Temple as a religious corporation that had a relationship with the Otani school and a comprehensive comprehensive structure was dissolved and it was considered to be integrated with the religious sects.
After that, the official name of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple was 'Shinshu Honbyo' (Honbyo Mausoleum) (Honbyo Mausoleum) (Honbyo Mausoleum) in which the believers of the same sect listened to the teachings of the founder of the sect, Shinran became a believer of the Konpon dojo and became a believer of Shinran.
There is also a meaning that the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) Higashi Hongan-ji school was differentiated from the Jodo Shinshu sect Higashi Hongan-ji school.

In the Edo period, four fires were destroyed by fire during the Edo period, and many of the existing buildings were rebuilt after Dondon-yaki (fire burning) due to a large number of fires and many of the existing buildings were reconstructed in the Meiji period, but architecture, wall paintings and so on were collected in the techniques of those days.
The Miei-do hall which houses the statue of Shinran is the largest structure in the world (the building is covered by the preservation of the roof).
The Mie-mon Gate is one of the Sam-mon Gate (three major gates).
It is a collection of "Kenjodo shinjitsu gyogyogyosho monrui" (a national treasure), which is a collection of books written by Shinran.
Shosei-en Garden in the detached precinct is a place of scenic beauty.
The current head of the temple is Choken OTANI (Jonyo).

Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is a god (Shinto religion) appearing in Japanese Mythology.
In the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), '天照' is referred to as 'Amateru.'
It is a deity that deifies the sun, and is considered to be one of the soshin (ancestor honored as god) of the Imperial family.
In "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), Amaterasu Omikami is described as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) it is written as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
His other name was Ohirumenomuchi no Kami.
In "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the names of more than one god were listed in the names of the gods but in the "Kojiki" (Records of Ancient Matters), it was unified by the name of the god 'Ame no Ominokami (the god of heaven).
Although she was a goddess, there is a different opinion that she was actually a male deity.
As the name of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is used in political parts such as "Kaitai jingu Gishikicho" (list of ceremonies of the Kotai Jingu Shrine), Takamimusubi (Takamimusubi no kami) was originally the ancestor of the emperor and became the ancestor of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
In the case of Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amatsukurasu no Okami or Sumemi Oomikami no kami in front of the god, and it is also called Amateimasu Oomikami no Kami when the name of the god is performed in festivals.
In the academic document, it is now customary to write 'Amaterasu (Amatera)' and katakana (katakana (katakana character).
In ancient times, there is a theory that it was written as 天照太神.
Mythology
According to "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), when Izanagi was born from Yominokuni, who was living in Izanami, he was born when he washed his left eye when he washed off the impurities of the Yominokuni.
At that time, she was called Mitsuyomi, who was born from the right eye and Susanoo, who was born from the nose of her nose, and she was called Mikoshi (three noble children).
At that time, Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) to govern Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Susano who was entrusted to the sea was exiled by Izanagi because he wanted to go to Nenokuni, where Izanami lived.
Susanoo went to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven) before his older sister, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) went to Nenokuni, but Amaterasu Oomikami thought that his younger brother would bring Takamanohara (plain of high heaven) and waited for him.
In order to prove the purity of Susanoo, the three goddesses were born from the objects of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and Susano declared that Susano would win the victory in the victory of Susanoo in order to prove the purity of Susanoo.
The following five deities are believed to be the child of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and are believed to be the children of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Itsukuhikone
Kumanosubi
Susano was very fond of this, and as a result, Amaterasu Oomikami hid in Ama no Iwato (the heavenly rock cave) in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
In the world of the world, various troubles occurred.
(The eight hundred million gods such as Yagorogoro-no-kane no Mikoto and Amenokoyane no Mikoto in Chichibu no Kami of Chie no Kami were exiled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven) and Susanoo was exiled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
He sent his son Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no nakatsukuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains) to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
The pacification of Ashihara no nakatsukuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains) was pacified, and Amenooshihomimi descended to the throne while Ninigi's grandson Ninigi was born.
interpretation
In the mythology, there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami is the deification of the emperor who governed the country by taking religious services as a result of a scene in which Amatsu kami (Takamimusubi no kami) who was born earlier than him, or that of Takamimusubi no kami (Takamimusubi no kami) who was a god who was born earlier than him.
There is also a view that it was a deification of miko (shrine maiden) in ancient times.
Another name 'Hirume' is '日女女' (日日女) and refers to a shrine maiden who serves the sun god of the sun.
Although the sun god was originally a male god, there is a theory that a miko who served was regarded as the same god as the sun god and became a goddess.
There is also a theory that the goddess was born around the time of the Empress Jito, who was the empress of the woman, or that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
The birth of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Tsukuyomi no kami is pointed out in the "Reiho-gofu" of Taoism, and in the beginning of the seventh century, it is pointed out that 'eyes are the moon and moon' in "Kyoho-in-kyo" (before the sixth century), which is based on the influence of Taoism.
In addition, it is said that the term of the term "daijingu Shrine" refers to the belief that Amaterasu Omikami is enshrined in Ise-jingu Shrine, Jingu Shrine, Issuki no miya (vestal virgin princess serving at Ise-jingu Shrine), Itsuki no yata (purple robes) and "murasaki no onono" (purple robes), and "yomie" (white silk fabric), and "mite" (silk fabrics of silk fabric), and "usuri" (thin silk fabrics of silk fabric), and the term and "usu" (thin pieces of silk fabrics of silk fabrics of silk fabrics of silk fabrics of silk fabrics of silk fabric), which are believed to be the same as "daijingu Shrine" and "daijingu Shrine."
According to comparative mythology, the birth myths of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and others pointed out that it is almost the same as the Banko myths that have been recorded in the ancient era of the third and fourth centuries.
Also, there is a theory that it is a myth that it was introduced to Japan along with the ethnic movement in the earlier history because it is universally popular in Asia where both eyes are widely spread throughout the country.
In "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), there is a theory that the status of gods changed to three times.
The following are summarized as follows:
645: Taika Reforms
Before that, the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
The sun god itself is called 'Hinokami no kami' (the god of the sun).
A male god called 'Ama teru' was widely enshrined there.
In the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines that have the pronunciation of 'Akamatori-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima and 'Himematerui-jinja Shrine in Harima Province' in Tanba Province such as 'Amatsukuri-jinja Shrine.'
In addition, the term "otoko ameru" refers to another name of Amenohoakari, a grandson of Amaterasu, and also the ancestor of the Owari clan, the Tsumori clan and the Amabe clan.
In addition, Ninigi was a younger brother of Amenohoakari, and he was a great-grandfather of Emperor Jinmu.
672: The Jinshin War
Ohirumenomuchi no Machi (Princess Ohirume) is written as '大日大日女' or 'Tanakatsume' (Tanakatsume).
In this case, it is interpreted that the enshrined deity is Ohirume no Ki, and it is interpreted as 'Ameru,' a male god of snakes.
698: The shrine was founded by Kotai-jingu Shrine.
She was the ancestor of the Imperial Family,' 'Amaterasu and the Imperial Family.'
She was a goddess.
Emperor Jito was modeled after the god of nature and was created from the god of nature.
After that, '天照' other than the ancestor of the Imperial family was called 'Ameru.'
For example, in "Sarashina Nikki" (The Sarashina Diary) (around 1060), the part of 'Ameru no kami' was read as 'Ameru,' and in the "Sendai Kujihongi" (Ancient Japanese History), it was also written as '天照御神' (天皇神) and the word '天照' (天照神) was also used as 'Ameruhirume no mu' (天皇女女女) in the same way as 'Ameru' (天皇) in the "Sendai Kujihongi" (Ancient Japanese History).
In 1880 to 1881, there was a fierce controversy over the enshrined deity of the Shinto Jimukyoku (Bureau of Divination) that was built in Hibiya in Tokyo.
Shinto Jimukyoku insisted that the four deities of Zokasanjin (three deities enshrined in the Bureau of Divination) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) were enshrined in the Shinden-den Hall of the Jimukyoku (Bureau of Divination) as the enshrined deities in the Bureau of Divination, but the 'Izumo school' was based on the idea of 'Yugenichi' (all the world) and 'Yugenichi' (unifying the world of the world) was added to the belief that the deities of the gods were enshrined in the five great gods of the world of the afterlife.
However, the 'Ise school' which was the center of Shinto Jimukyoku was the 'presidency of heaven,' which Amaterasu Omikami ruled both the world and the other gods opposed to each other because they had a conflict with each other.
In the end, there were various theories such as 'The Izumo-ha group tried to kill the Senke Sonson who had a strong mind' and 'the Senke school had a strong heart in the Imperial family.'
Eventually, this dispute was decided by the Emperor Meiji's decision, and the status of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was considered to be the highest rank.
In addition, it is said that the government thought that it was impossible to control the people directly by the modern state due to the fact that the creed system of the creed system common to Shintoism, and that the modern nation thought it would be impossible to control the people directly by the Fukko Shinto.
Refer to the article of the controversy about the enshrined deity of the State Shinto Jimukyoku (Secretariat) of the State Shintoism.
When Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA appeared in his own novels, he was also known as 'Ohirumemuchi no Ki' (Ohirume no Kuchi) in his different name.
This is because the name 'Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess)' came to appear in the sentences that the ancestor god of the emperor could appear in the text, so the god of the sun and the nature of nature were not allowed to use the word 'Dainichihirume'.
In fact, many of the novels written by the AKUTAGAWA were not correct, correct, correcting, kajitsu and shocked by the census of the army.
Masaatsu YASUOKA (1898 - 1983) who established the Kinkei Gakuin (Kinkei Gakuin) was a belief in Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in Japan.
Amaterasu Omikami is an ideal to light the world with the spirit of Japan.
The ideal of 'izana' of Izanami, and Izanagi's 'izana' was to be a pioneer of the world and to become an invitorator.
Shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami
The shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami are called Shinmei-jinja Shrine and all over Japan, but the main shrine is the Naiku (inner shrine) of the Jingu (Ise-jingu Shrine) of the Ise-jingu Shrine.
Kotai-jingu Shrine is one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family, and it is a shrine that enshrines Yata no Kagami (mirror) as an object of worship.
Most of the shrines across Japan distribute shinsatsu of Kotai-jingu Shrine (Kosho-daijingu Shrine) as shinsatsu.

Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in the Edo period
In the Edo period, daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) were determined according to kakaku (family status), kani (social status), kokudaka (crop yields), and shikoseki (families which were allowed to enter the Imperial Palace) in the Edo period.
Firstly, according to the relationship between the Tokugawa Shogun family and the Tokugawa Shogun family, it is classified as the Gokamon (relatives of the Tokugawa family), the fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who were mainly vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, and the tozama daimyo who became vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara.
The first Shogun Ieyasu established Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) which were allowed to use the surname of Tokugawa as well as to keep the blood line when the Shogun family was extinguished and to keep the bloodline line and to control the daimyo throughout the country and to support the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and also established Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) with the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA of Owari Domain and the tenth son of Yorinobu TOKUGAWA in Owari Domain and the Mito Domain in the Owari Domain as well as the eleventh son Yorifusa TOKUGAWA.
In addition, he appointed Hideyasu YUKI who was the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA to the Echizen Domain and a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) of the Tokugawa clan across the country.
In addition, the fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who built the foundation of the Tokugawa Shogun family as Fudai fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) was established as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) for successive generations, and in addition to securing the military power of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), he assisted the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in important posts such as Tairo (chief councilor of state) of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
The fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) was relatively low, and the Hikone Domain of the Ii clan, the head of fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) was given a large fief of 50,000 koku, and the Torii clan, the Sakakibara clan, the Honda clan and the Ogasawara clan gained a relatively large amount of rice crop in the Edo period, but only the Sakai clan, the Abe clan, the Horida clan, the Yanagisawa clan, and the Toda clan were the only one of the fudai daimyo who maintained more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period.
This came to be due to the separation of power and military power.
The tozama daimyo were daimyo who were subordinate after the Battle of Sekigahara and many families opposed to the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara.
In addition, the bakufu was strongly wary and actively engaged in spy activities by secret agents, and he was severely punished by being punished by being deprived of his fief when he was afraid of misjustice.

In addition, the territories which were more than one koku or more of kokudaka (crop yield) were classified according to the social status of daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) or the jinya (regional government office) that had no castle were called kokushu (lord of a castle) or jinya (regional government office) in Edo-jo Castle according to the social status of feudal lords.
For more information, refer to the article of "shikoseki (seats for feudal lords in the Edo period)."
Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) were not allowed to have a fief of 100,000 koku (crop yields) of rice crops, and most of them had territories around the castle town and other areas.
In an extreme case, one village was divided into other feudal lords (shokyu).
The Kiregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was 5000 koku (crop yields) in principle, although it was more than 10,000 koku.
This is because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan.
