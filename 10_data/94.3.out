<unk> was a Zen monk in the early Kamakura period .
He was the founder of the Soto sect .
In his later years , he was also called <unk> .
In the same religious doctrine , he was honorifically called Koso .
His posthumous name was <unk> Daishi ( priest ) .
It is generally called Dogen Zenji .
It is said that he spread the manners and cleaning manners of eating meals in Japan .
There is a theory that he first brought back <unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) .
Although there are many questions about Dogen 's birth , there are various theories on the fact that he was born in the direct line of Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO ( MINAMOTO no Michichika and Michichika KOGA ) , who was Naidaijin ( Minister of the Interior ) .
According to the established theory , he was born as a son of Michichika and FUJIWARA no Ishi , a daughter of FUJIWARA no Motofusa ( Motofusa ) MATSUDONO , who was the daughter of Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) Motofusa MATSUDONO ( FUJIWARA no Motofusa ) , but recently , the theory has become widely accepted that he was the biological child of Michitomo HORIKAWA , who was the foster father .
There is also a theory that Michichika 's son MINAMOTO no Michimune , MINAMOTO no Michimune , and Michiteru KOGA were his father .
According to his biography " <unk> " ( The Diary of <unk> ) , he lost his father ( Michichika ) at the age of three , lost his mother at the age of eight , and was adopted by his older paternal half - brother , Michitomo HORIKAWA .
According to one theory , after the death of his parents , he wanted to adopt his maternal uncle Moroie MATSUDONO ( former regent and minister of the Interior ) , who was his maternal uncle , as an adopted heir of the Matsudono family , but it is also said that Dogen , who felt the impermanence of the world , declined .
There is a theory that Shinran , the founder of the Jodo Shinshu Sect , was acquainted with each other with his maternal relatives , but it is not confirmed .
There is a theory that the volume of his work " Shobogenzo " ( Treasury of True Teaching ) was written for Shinran .
In 1213 , he visited his maternal uncle <unk> , who was on the side of Mt. Hiei .
In 1214 , he became a priest with the title of Tendai - zasu ( head priest of the Tendai sect ) , <unk> , and took the name of Dogen .
In 1215 , he studied the Tendai sect under <unk> of Onjo - ji Temple .
He studied under Myozen , a disciple of Eisai at Kennin - ji Temple in 1217 .
In 1223 , along with Myozen , he went over Mt. Mimoro from Hakata to the Southern Sung Dynasty and received Inka ( Certification of spiritual achievement ) from Nyojo Tendo of the Soto sect .
In 1228 , he returned to Japan .
He founded Kosho - ji Temple in Fukakusa , Kyoto in 1233 .
At that time , he was oppressed by Mt. Hiei .
In July 1243 , he was invited by Yoshishige HATANO , jito ( manager and lord of manor ) of Echizen Province , and moved to Echizen <unk> no sho .
On the way , the invitation of Nobutsuna SASAKI , the feudal lord of Kutsuki - mura , Kutsuki - mura , <unk> - mura ( the origin of Kosho - ji Temple ( Takashima City ) )
He founded Osaragi - ji Temple in Kasamatsu in 1244 .
In 1246 , he changed the name of Osaragi - ji Temple to Eihei - ji Temple and changed his pen name to <unk> .
At this time , he went down to Kamakura to invite the regent Tokiyori HOJO and Yoshishige HATANO .
The period of edification in Kamakura lasted for half a year , but it became the beginning of pure Zen in the Kanto region .
In 1253 , he handed over Eihei - ji Temple to his disciple Koun Ejo , and died at the residence of his disciple <unk> <unk> ( Takatsuji - dori Street , Kyoto City ) , and at the age of 54 ( 53 years old ) .
The cause of his death is said to have been <unk> .
It was not completed at a certain level , but also as a Buddha who sought to become a Buddha , it was the essence of Buddhahood ( <unk> ) and insisted that it was the supreme practice of mediation ( <unk> ) , followed by Shaka .
Many of the Kamakura Buddhism agreed on the Mappo - shiso ( the end of the Dharma ) , but " Shobogenzo " ( Treasury of True Teaching ) says , " Today , we can not say this word " <unk> " and " Shobogenzo " ( Treasury of True Teaching ) .
It is a hoben ( expedient ) for a long time to stand Shozo <unk> ( <unk> ) in Buddhism .
The truth of the story is only the truth .
<unk> ã€‚
He was not always good at the time of a Buddhist priest .
There is also a reflection of the mysterious and mysterious nature , and the mind of Sengen - san Mountain is <unk> .
It is to mean that Buddha , precepts , and so on , and all sentient beings and people are living in the world .
It became a Buddhist priest .
When I am not able to do so , I should not be able to do anything , and I will not always have any excellent disciples of Shakyamuni 's disciples , so that Mappo denied Mappo ( Age of the Final Dharma ) and denied Mappo ( Age of the Final Dharma ) .

Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum , located in <unk> - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture , is a storage facility for steam locomotives managed by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) .
On October 10 , 1972 , the Japan National Railways started its 100th anniversary of the opening of Japan National Railways to use a fan - shaped facility in Umekoji Ward , Kyoto City , and it was the first facility in Japan to use steam locomotives that had been supported by Japan 's railway transportation in the first century , and to preserve it as a valuable industrial cultural property .
With the division and privatization of Japan National Railways in 1987 , JR West succeeded to Japan .
This facility itself is a regular car ( Umekoji Ward ) , and it is also conducted by the JNR <unk> diesel locomotives owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway and the JNR <unk> diesel locomotives .
In the first place , this facility was established to preserve steam locomotives , which had rapidly disappeared from the latter half of the 1960 's .
At first , Oyama Ward , which was located in Oyama Station , Tochigi Prefecture , was the most likely candidate for the preservation of the body , but it was located in ' the central part of Japan , ' and therefore , Umekoji Ward ( at that time ) was formally selected as a preservation body in 1970 because it was located in the ' central part of Japan . '
Although it was considered to be selected as the oldest car ( if possible ) existing in principle , there were also some cars that were supposed to be selected as the C62 C62 C62 Type 2 , like those that were supposed to be preserved .
The facilities were derived from " Steam Locomotive Museum " which used the <unk> and a <unk> of the former Umekoji Engine Depot , " and " Museum of Materials " which was relocated and restored the former Nijo Station building .
The <unk> - ro was a reinforced concrete structure constructed in 1914 , and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the <unk> - <unk> ( completed in 1915 ) and the <unk> Line .
In the same year , 2004 , it was preserved for the civil engineering site for the study of Kokkagakkai .
In 2006 , the former Nijo Station building ( exhibition hall ) , which had been preserved by JR West , was designated as a quasi - railway monument by the National Railways National Corporation as well as a set of tools for steam locomotives and repairs .
The former Nijo station building was constructed in 1904 by imitating the Heian - jingu Shrine in consideration of its scenery , although it was the oldest wooden building that was constructed by the Kyoto Railway Company as its headquarters .
The Kyoto Railway was nationalized in 1907 , and later it was used as a station building of JR West , but in 1996 , it ended up its role as a station building when the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) and Hanazono Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) were elevated , and it was moved to the main building and reconstructed in 1997 as a entrance hall , and used the old ticket room as a museum .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
In the fan - shaped magazine , 16 domestic steam locomotives manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period ( 16 cars were initially opened ) are displayed and displayed .
At the beginning of the opening , there were two types of <unk> and <unk> , which were generally preserved in a dynamic state , and it was registered by 15 cars , but later , in 2006 , the object of preserving cars were reviewed several times , and the preservation machine has become 7 - ryo .
Among the five cars , five cars are currently registered , and two cars ( C57 <unk> , 56 <unk> , 56 <unk> ) are served on the main line of the Yamaguchi Line , such as ' Yamaguchi ( train ) ' and ' Kita Biwako ( train ) ' on the Hokuriku Main Line .
Although there are no registration machine other than these two locomotives , it is impossible to run on the main line because it is not fully inspected .
In addition , the ' SL SL <unk> ' ( SL SL <unk> ) , which was pulled by the steam machine for display in the museum , is operated by the railway .
This display route was once extended from the depot to the north of the site where a large - sized car parking lot was now available ( a rest facility and a park once stood ) , but it was moved to the north of the former Nijo Station building building , and it was changed to a side of the Sagano Line by side .
It is still connected with the operating line as a facility .
After the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company was closed , it was also maintained by steam locomotives .
Plum trees
It originates from ' Ume ' ( plum ) which means Umekoji .
Except for all of the cars of C62 Type <unk> , which had been designated in 1976 , all of them were designated as quasi - quasi - quasi - railway monuments along with the number of cars and the <unk> of conservative tools in 2006 .
The procedure to transfer from the former organization organization organization in 1972 is taken from the former organization organization .
The left - hand priest has no registered car since it has been preserved in Umekoji .

Shomyo is one of the Japanese traditional music .
It is a religious music used for rituals in Buddhist scriptures and Buddhist scriptures and is used for rituals .
In Japan , it is also called <unk> or <unk> .
It is written as " <unk> " in old Chinese characters .
It is one of the fields of ancient India .
The term " Shomyo " refers to five fields of learning : Shomyo ( phonology , grammar , and grammar ) , <unk> ( science ) , <unk> ( learning ) , Inmyo ( learning ) , Inmyo ( learning ) ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , and <unk> ( ethics ( ethics ) , and Buddhist scholars ) .
It was introduced to Japan along with the introduction of Buddhism .
In 754 , a Buddhist memorial service was held at the time of the ceremony to consecrate the Great Buddha of Todai - ji Temple , and it is believed that Shomyo was actively practiced in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai handed down the Buddhist Shomyo and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and the Shingon Shomyo .
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect also have their own Buddhist Shomyo , and they are still handed down even today .
The chanting of the Buddhist hymns was passed down by <unk> , so the scores were not found .
Therefore , the teaching of the school was extremely difficult .
Later , a musical score , which was a score , was invented .
In addition , there are differences in terms of professional terms such as hakase ( professor ) depending on each school .
However , the meaning of hakase is a reference for chanting , and if to learn Shomyo , it is necessary to practice kuden ( oral instruction ) ( also called <unk> ) , and it is necessary to maintain and inherit the school from the teacher to his disciples .
Therefore , it was necessary to educate the leader and successor successors .
With various conditions , many schools were abolished .
The Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) was introduced by Saicho , which led to the foundation of the Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) , and developed its own unique development .
After Saicho , Ennin and <unk> became prosperous .
Ryonin , the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu , is known as the restorer of the temple .
In 1109 , Ryonin built Raigo - in Temple ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) in Ohara , Kyoto .
Its sango ( literally , " mountain name " ) , which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple , was <unk> , which was the origin of Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) in Ohara .
Later , two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the training hall of Ohara School Shomyo Shomyo .
In addition , <unk> HARA later had no school , and in Ohara there was a statement of the two schools .
Later , <unk> restored Ohara Shomyo .
It was founded by Tankai to establish a flow based on the new music theory .
After that , he did not have the center of the Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) and was handed down to the present Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu sect , Jodo sect , and Jodo Shinshu Shomyo ( chanting of the Buddhist chant ) are the lineage of Tendai Shomyo .
The mantra chanting of the Shingon sect has been passed down by Kukai , and has been based on the present day .
It was after Shinga that the chanting of Buddhist hymns had been systematized .
It can be said that Kancho was the founder of the renaissance .
He worked for the music and maintenance of Shomyo ( Buddhist hymns ) .
Until the Kamakura period , there were many schools , but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakuho by four schools ( <unk> - ryu , Shin - Daigo - ryu , Daigo - ryu , and Nakagawa - ryu ) .
The reading of Kogi Shingon Sect declined and disappeared from the Edo period .
The <unk> - ryu , the Shin - in school , the Daigo - ryu school , and the Daigo - ryu school were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
At present , it is divided into <unk> ( Chishaku - in Temple in Kyoto ) , <unk> Shomyo ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) ( Hase - dera Temple in Nara ) , <unk> ( Mt. Koya , Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The chanting of the Shingon sect Chisan Shomyo , Buzan Shomyo ( Shingi Shingon sect ) , Buzan school , Buzan school , Shingon sect Buzan school , and both schools were originally derived from the Nakagawa Taijo School .
Raiyu adopted the school of Daigo .
In 1583 , when Negoro - ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and fell into decline , the two schools of Chisan and Buzan came to form a group based on the old school of Daigo .
Its characteristics are ' <unk> ' ( debate ) of Buzan and ' Shomyo ' ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) .
The <unk> School ( Kogi Shingon sect ) , which was based on the Nakagawa <unk> School .
The Nakagawa Daishin - ryu school was founded by <unk> of Nakagawa - ji Temple in Nara .
In the Joei era ( 1232 - 1233 ) , the base of Mt. Koya <unk> and Sanbo - in Temple was moved to Mt. Koya .
Later , it was named Nanzan - san , which was another name of Mt. Koya , and was named Nanzan - san .
It is also referred to as the <unk> School and the <unk> School .
It can be said that the music of Heikyoku , Yokyoku , folk song , Joruri ( dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment ) , and so on changed into Shomyo .
It had a great influence on the melody melody .

June 14 , 645 : The investiture of the Crown Prince
August 24 , 661 - Shosei ( official Shosei )
Emperor Tenchi ( February 20 , 668 ) - ascended the throne
He died on January 7 , 672 at the age of 46 .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief Brief History of Japan ) , it is said that the Emperor Tenmu was killed in the mountains because he said , ' It was a person who received an arrow from the Emperor , <unk> Yamashina no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> '
The reason why Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time was one of the mystery of politics in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories regarding this .
It was in consideration of Emperor Tenmu 's power that recommended Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , it is wrong that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is based on the theory that he was the maternal half - brother of Emperor Tenchi , who gave birth to Emperor Jomei before he married Emperor Jomei , and that he was the maternal half - brother of Emperor Tenchi .
In fact , if calculating the year of birth based on the year of Emperor Tenmu 's death in some history books of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , Emperor Tenmu became older .
However , there are no contradictions between the same historical materials , and there are many historical materials that have the age of 8 to 9 .
On the other hand , there is an opinion that ' although the father is different , the younger brother will be sent to his older brother , ' and therefore , the age of Emperor Tenchi was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the age of the Emperor Jomei , who was at the age of 16 , died when he was the father of Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the real year of birth was 614 , which was adopted by Honcho koin jounroku ( the Emperor 's family tree ) and others .
In ancient times , there was no interregnum ( in fact , Emperor Tenchi and Empress Jito , who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu , also reigned as Emperor Tenmu , did not ascend the throne immediately .
It was because of the error .
There is also an opinion that the theory of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) was pointed out as " <unk> " or " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the other historical books were compiled , therefore , there is a different opinion that they were not necessarily identical .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age . ' )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat by Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Prince Naka no Oe was driven out of power .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good , and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of the Prince Naka no Oe .
In this way , Prince Naka no Oe no Oji did not have a motive to kill Iruka .
In addition , the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) has been <unk> , and this theory came to be advocated .
In this theory , the Soga clan other than Iruka had not been expelled after the coup because of the reasons for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka had not been purged , and therefore , they received attention to explain other questions .
It is said that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to the opposition from the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi .
This suggests that Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , indicated the relationship between her wife , Hashihito no Himemiko ( younger maternal half - sister of Emperor Tenchi ) and Emperor Tenchi .
Although his love and marriage were permitted between her paternal half - brothers and sisters , it was interpreted that she was not allowed to love people in those days ; however , it was interpreted that she actually had a relationship with people in a rainbow in the sky of <unk> <unk> , and she was persuaded by her uncle Karu no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) , who had married her husband , to her husband , and she was caught in the scene of Arima no miko .
After the death of Empress Saimei , Hashihito no Himemiko succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the empress of the previous emperor , but there is a theory that the records were deleted for some reason .
This is because the " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) states that ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' came from Hashihito no Himemiko , and ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' can be interpreted as the interim emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .
If Hashihito no Himemiko is referred to as ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' , there is a theory that says that she was the Empress Saimei , however , there is no definite evidence .
Although it is difficult to prove the nature of the political history and the restrictions of historical materials , it is possible to prove it , and the development of research in the future including cooperation with archaeological results .

Saion - ji Temple was a court noble who was descended from the Fujiwara clan .
The family was descended from the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan , and its social standing was the Seiga family .
The Toin family and the Imadegawa family ( Kikutei family ) were separated from the Saionji family .
The Saionji clan , a samurai family in Iyo Province , was also a powerful branch of the Saionji family who used the family name of Saionji .
Its kamon ( family crest ) is Hidari mitsudomoe ( three comma - shaped comma - shaped figures ) .
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Suemichi , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane .
When Kintsune SAIONJI , the great - grandson of Michisue , married MINAMOTO no Yoritomo 's niece as his wife during the Jokyu War , he was confined to the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and after the Jokyu War , he gained the trust of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and gained the real power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi ( liaison officer in the Kanto region ) and raised his family status to Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) .
The family name of Saion - ji Temple derives from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his second residence in Kyoto ( Kitayama no sho , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono , and the present Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA over this land .
He was supported by the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) from Kintsune , and gained power over the Sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) through the Kamakura period .
Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) and gave his daughter to Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
After his son , Kinhira SAIONJI , however , the Daikakuji - to line came to place a distance from the bakufu , and this led to a conflict with the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) .
Later , in the era of Kinmune SAIONJI , the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) fell and was dismissed from Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO ( Tokioki ) , who was the remnants of the Hojo clan , and assassinated Emperor Godaigo , who started the Kenmu Restoration , and planned a scheme to assassinate the Retired Emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin - to ( imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu ) and planned to enthrone the Retired Emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin - to ( imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu ) , and therefore , Kinmune was arrested and executed .
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Sanetoshi SAIONJI , the son of Kinmune SAIONJI , served the Northern Court ( Japan ) and became Udaijin ( Minister of the Right ) and restored the family name .
In the Muromachi and Edo periods , it was also known as a family which specialized in biwa ( Japanese lute ) .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI invited Tadataka HOSOKAWA , the legitimate son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later disinherited ) , and his eldest daughter Tokuhime , who was the heir of Kyumu NAGAOKA , to serve as a Midaidokoro ( a wife of a shogun ) , but Nagaoka Kyumu NAGAOKA received various funds from the Saionji family and donated 600 stones to the Saionji family ( <unk> ) .
At the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from the Tokudaiji family of the same Kanin line , and after the Meiji Restoration , he served as an adopted politician and served as Prime Minister , and played an important role in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods as a Genro .
Incidentally , Kinmochi was not like playing biwa ( Japanese lute ) , which was supposed to be the family business of the Saionji family , but was said to have been ' to listen to the biwa of the Saionji family for a long time , ' and there is a story that he was forced to play with gagaku ( ancient Japanese court dance and music ) player of the Imperial Household Ministry and biwa ( Japanese lute ) in order to make them go out of obscurity .

Therefore , it is natural to say that the decline of the Michitaka family was not written ( same as the above - mentioned above ) .
Even in the period of despair , even when people who surround chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) and chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) were in despair , they also claimed that they lived in the world of Yoshihisa ( Ueno no ri [ law of Kozuke Province ] ) .
Public evaluation
She appeared in the <unk> style ( <unk> AKIYAMA ) , who tried to forget the class from Sei Shonagon , to assimilate into the upper reaches of the school .
( This is because it does not have any honorific title for those who have high social status than their relatives . )
It was just a ' Record of Civilization in the empress 's residence ' and was not written by the qualification of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ISHIDA ) .
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( also known as Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) was the 15th seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ( his reign was from January 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 ) .
He was the only shogun who did not work as a shogun in Edo - jo Castle .
He served as a senior vassal , and received the First Order of Merit .
He was a member of the House of Peers .
After the death of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the 14th Shogun , who had acted as a guardian of the shogun , he assumed the post of the 15th shogun of the Edo bakufu .
After the Emperor Meiji returned the government to the Imperial Court ( Taisei Hokan ) , he tried to unite the imperial court and the shogunate , but in the Battle of Toba and Fushimi after the Restoration of Imperial Rule ( Japan ) , he returned from Osaka - jo Castle to Edo - jo Castle , leaving the former Shogunate army , and was ordered to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court , and surrendered Edo - jo Castle .
After he was removed from house arrest in the Meiji period , he devoted himself to hobbies and lived as a prince until the Taisho period .
Yoshinobu ' is also read as ' <unk> ' or ' <unk> ' as his common name .
In the official documents of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , there is a record that " <unk> " was read as " <unk> . "
His name was also written as ' <unk> ' in the English language and English newspaper by himself .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often referred to as ' <unk> , ' but in Shizuoka City , where he spent the rest of his life , he is often called ' <unk> . '
According to the person who knew Yoshinobu during his lifetime , Yoshinobu himself liked to be called ' <unk> sama ' and he also used his name as ' <unk> ' to his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
It is said that Yoshinobu succeeded Yoshinobu as well as Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA , who was also known as ' <unk> ' by people around him .
It is considered that there are two ways of calling them ' <unk> sama ' and ' <unk> san ' ( <unk> ) , and it is quite rare today , but it can be confirmed not only in Shizuoka but also in various places , and it is often used to refer to " <unk> " in both cases .
Ryotaro SHIBA said that ' the people called " <unk> " were mostly related to the former retainers of the shogun , but it is possible that they were highly respected in a wide range of areas because they could be used even by people related to the Higo Domain who had been engaged in the overthrow of the Shogunate . '
He was born on September 29 , 1837 as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was the shogun who adopted the lawful wife of Imperial Princess Yoshiko ( the third Shogun , Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is considered to be the lawful wife of his father Hidetada , but there is also a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was <unk> .
In accordance with Nariaki 's education policy , ' the boy is brought up in his hometown , ' he moved to Mito Domain seven months after his birth , and lived there until he inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and was taught about learning and martial arts from <unk> and others .
Yoshinobu 's <unk> seemed to have received attention from those days , so Nariaki was not adopted by other families , and at first , he thought that he would be kept in hand as a seat for his eldest son Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered him to appoint <unk> to the Mito Domain as a successor of the Hitotsubashi family , the gosankyo ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) .
In response to this , Shichiro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December , he took the name of Yoshinobu from Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA , the 12th shogun .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi - tei residence and thought Yoshinobu as a leading candidate for the heir of the shogun , but he gave up the offer of roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) Masahiro ABE .
In 1853 , in the midst of the confusion in the arrival of the Black Ships , Ieyoshi died of illness , and Iesada TOKUGAWA , the 13th shogun , who succeeded Ieyoshi , had no chance to have a son and had a son , and therefore , there was a problem that ' the heir to the shogun ' ( the heir of the shogun ) was born ( the issue of the heir ) .
The Hitotsubashi group , including Nariaki , Masahiro ABE , and Nariakira SHIMAZU , the lord of the Satsuma Domain , and Naosuke II , the lord of the Hikone Domain , who recommended Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA , the lord of the Kishu Domain , and Honjuin , the real mother of Iesada , opposed the Nanki group .
The Hitotsubashi group tried to make Tenshoin , an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , to the O - oku ( inner halls of Edo Castle ) as Shogun and Midaidokoro ( shogun 's wife ) , but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another , the Tairo ( chief minister ) Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 , came to be called ' Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA ' and decided that ' the heir of the Shogun would be heir . '
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States .
Yoshinobu went to the castle with Nariaki , Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of Fukui Domain , and others , and questioned Naosuke , however , he was accused of his crime at the castle , and in 1859 , he retired ( Ansei no Taigoku [ suppression of extremists by Shogunate ] ) .
In addition , Yoshinobu himself sent a letter to Nariaki saying , ' I do n't want you to do so , but I will not want to take over the whole country , ' which means that Yoshinobu himself would become the heir of the shogun .
In 1860 , he was suspended from house arrest .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy Shigetomi OHARA , who was guarded by the Satsuma Domain soldiers led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , went to Edo and received an imperial order from the Emperor Komei to appoint Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga ) to the Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On August 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as Shogun 's guardian and Shungaku to Seiji sosai ( President of the Government ) .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku carried out the reformation of the shogunate government , called Bunkyu Reforms , and established Kyoto shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) , <unk> of Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) and so on .
In 1863 , he went up to Kyoto as a pioneer of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the shogun , and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court , which urged the expulsion of foreigners .
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , Iemochi received a sword from the Emperor and had to carry out Joi ( expulsion of foreigners ) , so he called himself ' <unk> ' ( a cold fever ) and forced Iemochi to stop his audience with Iemochi .
When the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians ) led by the Choshu Domain was expelled in the Coup of August 18 , he returned to Kyoto to participate in the Council of Sanyo ( a political party ) by the Kobu Gattai ( integration of the shogunate and the shogunate ) and Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Shogun ) .
However , if the conference was not concluded , he was drunk at a drinking party with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko , and <unk> DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , who were together together with Imperial Prince Asahiko Asahiko , and furthermore , he also tried to make him decide to collapse of the system by saying , ' We should be given by Shimazu . '
After that , he stayed in Kyoto and was appointed as the Governor of the Imperial Palace to guard the Imperial Palace , and together with Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Aizu Domain ) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Kuwana Domain ) , the governor of the Kuwana Domain ) , and the Imperial Court , together with the Imperial Court , he was appointed as the pro - Imperial loyalists and the court nobles ( the Aizu Domain , Aizu Domain , Kuwana Domain , Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA and his retainers of the Mito Domain , including Kounsai TAKEDA , who supported Yoshinobu , were <unk> .
In 1864 , in the Kinmon Incident , he commanded the army of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and attacked the Choshu army , which occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of the Choshu Domain was finished , he worked hard for the imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States , which had been an imperial sanction , and succeeded in obtaining an Imperial sanction on condition .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an Imperial order to subjugate Choshu .
However , the Satsuma Domain refused to send troops to the Satsuma Domain , which formed the Satsuma - Choshu Alliance , and the bakufu army was defeated .
On August 20 , during the second conquest of Choshu , Shogun Iemochi died at Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu made a campaign to the Imperial Court and raised an Imperial edict to cease - fire , and succeeded in concluding a cease - fire agreement .
Although Iemochi was recommended to succeed Iemochi 's position , Yoshinobu firmly declined the offer .
On September 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family succeeded to the position of shogun , but he continued to refuse .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) and others requested him to become shogun , but they did not accept it , and on January 5 , he was appointed as shogun by the Imperial proclamation of Emperor Komei .
In other words , it was intended to promote the government by selling the favor of the shogun , and to make it advantageous to the shogun .
Yoshinobu established Yokosuka Iron Factory , Construction Construction and <unk> <unk> with the help of French minister LÃ©on LÃ©on LÃ©on <unk> , and invited military advisers including Jules Brunet to reform the military system .
Also , his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was sent to the Paris World Exposition , and encouraged the students of the shogun 's retainers to study in Europe .
In the issue of the opening of the port of Hyogo , the Imperial Court insisted on the opening of the port and obtained an imperial sanction .
On October 14 , 1867 , Yoshinobu , who was forced to go down to Satsuma and Choshu , reported the Imperial Court that he would return the government to the Imperial Court ( Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power to the Emperor ) ) .
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time judged that there was no administrative ability , and tried to survive the Tokugawa government in the form of a council of feudal lords .
However , the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in January , and Yoshinobu was ordered to ' Jikan nochi ' ( the Minister of the Interior and the Tokugawa domain ) ( dedicated by the Minister of the Interior and the Tokugawa family ) .
Yoshinobu left the Osaka - jo Castle to avoid a conflict , and gathered foreign ministers and other ministers of foreign countries and insisted on the legitimacy of the Tokugawa shogunate , and furthermore , he made the Imperial Court a movement to <unk> the Jikan nochi ( the Jikan nochi ) to make it calm .
However , in 1868 , the Satsuma Domain raised an army by provoked by the Satsuma Domain in Edo and blocked Kyoto with the soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana Domains .
However , in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , which broke out on January 3 , when the former Shogunate army was in a disadvantageous situation , and even though they still maintained enough military strength , they left behind their soldiers and retreated to Edo with " <unk> " ( literally , " Maru Warship " ) .
Soon after that , the Imperial army led by Prince Arisugawa no Miya Taruhito started to attack Yoshinobu as an enemy of the Emperor 's enemy .
Yoshinobu insisted on obedience to the resistance party including Tadaosa OGURI and others .
In February , he left the situation to Kaishu KATSU and confined himself to the Daiji - in Temple of Ueno Kanei - ji Temple .
The head of the Tokugawa family was transferred to his adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU ( later Iesato TOKUGAWA ) .

On December 8 , he retired .
He died on November 22 , 1913 ( 10 minutes in the morning ) .
On the same day , he received Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flower .
As for studying martial arts and learning , he grew up in the highest environment , and was enthusiastic about the art of shuriken and was an expert of shuriken .
Even after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he practiced shuriken ( shuriken ) in his forehead and was counted as the most famous person among the masters of shuriken .
When his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , tried to make a problem when he was a successor of the Tokugawa family , he had a <unk> ( a <unk> ) in order to <unk> the Tokugawa family , and when he was sleeping , he had a <unk> ( a <unk> ) ( it seems that he did not have to have a mistake when he was injured ) .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote in which when he came of age , he went to sleep with three wives and concubines as a measure to assassinate him .
Although Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph of his childhood , it is questionable whether he was Yoshinobu himself .
It is said that he visited Iemochi , who fell ill , to ask him to visit him , and that he usually exchanged with him .
Tatewaki AJIMA , the father of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , was known for his <unk> and commented on Yoshinobu as ' a faithful retainer of the Tokugawa family , ' and when Yoshinobu was looking at the expectation of recovery of the Tokugawa clan , he was able to become a shogun , ' he was praised by him as ' the second coming of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA . '
Hideaki of Yoshinobu was also well known for the anti - shogunate group , and Takayoshi KIDO of Choshu Domain , especially Takayoshi KIDO , who was a member of the Choshu clan , did not have a good relationship with Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI .
He was wary of Ieyasu 's coming of life . '
In response to the decision of Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , Ryoma SAKAMOTO said , " The great shogun ( shogun ) , and the present - day suicide is <unk> . "
It may be said that he would often agree with the decision .
He praised Yoshinobu as ' I am alive for my loyalty , ' and tried to give Yoshinobu the position of vice chief chancellor of the new government to him .
However , it was in the Meiji period that Yoshinobu himself knew the existence of Ryoma 's personality ( after Ryoma 's death ) .
It was not limited to Yoshinobu , and Ryoma 's reputation was very low than that after the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi and ran back to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy 's side by saying ' The enemy of the enemy . '
At this time , the umajirushi of <unk> , which had been taken since Ieyasu , were forgotten , but some of them did not forget his favorite favorite concubine , so some people <unk> Yoshinobu 's favorite concubine .
However , there is also a view that it was necessary to resist armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Province , and Yoshinobu had to become an enemy of the Emperor , so many daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) defected from the enemy , and even if he was able to guard Osaka - jo Castle , it was necessary to prevent foreign intervention .
On the other hand , he was regarded as a person who valued the Emperor and the Imperial Court because he was considered as an enemy of the Emperor , or because he was confined to Kanei - ji Temple , but it is considered that he had a great influence on Mitogaku ( the scholarship and academic traditions of Mito ) , which was thought to have been a thought of reverence for the Emperor , and his mother was from the Imperial Family , and on the other hand , he was also said to have been ' weak ' because he did not deal with the enemy as a lord .
Due to the bloodless surrender of Edo - jo Castle and the bloodless surrender of the Edo - jo Castle , the independence of modern Japan was protected and it was highly evaluated as a great contribution to the Meiji Restoration .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed as the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and had a friendly relationship with him even after the Meiji Restoration .
SHIBUSAWA , in the later days of Yoshinobu , tried to compile a biography of Yoshinobu , and persuaded Yoshinobu to persuade him , and opened the ' <unk> - kai ' ( <unk> - kai ) .
The " <unk> <unk> " was compiled .
In a part of the book , it can be seen that Yoshinobu 's old age would be seen .
When he was at the time of his birth , he was asked to ask him for a good reason , and he said , ' Hisamitsu SHIMAZU did n't like Hisamitsu , ' ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a <unk> person , ' and he showed his feelings and feelings of his personality .
Based on these materials , it was completed after Yoshinobu 's death in " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA 's official introduction . "
In order to show his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji , who gave the title of duke , who was granted the highest rank of the nobility , to the Emperor Meiji who pardoned him as an enemy of the Emperor , Yoshinobu left his will to offer his funeral instead of a Shinto funeral .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was built not only in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family of the Zojo - ji Temple , the family temple of the Tokugawa family , but also in Yanaka Cemetery , the same round barrow as that of the Imperial Family .
This was because the mausoleum of the Emperor Komei was impressed by the fact that the mausoleum of the Emperor Komei was modest ( " Tokugawa Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA <unk> " ) .
After he was pardoned , Yoshinobu spent his life in a quiet life without thinking of the former shogun 's retainers who had dedicated his life to him , so Katsukiyo ITAKURA , a roju ( senior councilor ) at that time , regretted that ' Yoshinobu acted together with Yoshinobu . '
Although he had an image of <unk> in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , such as ' <unk> ' ( escaping enemies ) , it has recently been <unk> to establish a new modern political system after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and there is also a movement to re - evaluation of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Historical drama ) .
As with his father Nariaki , pork of the Satsuma Domain was favored by his father , and he was called <unk> Hitotsubashi - sama , which liked pork .
In addition , in his later years , he was interested in Western culture , liked bread and milk , and enjoyed his hobbies such as photographs , photographs by camera , fishing , bicycle , <unk> , <unk> , and handicraft ( embroidery ) , but it seems that he learned French from Amane NISHI ( illuminator ) , however , he failed .
Although he was famous as a camera , he seems to have never improved the camera skills .
It is said that he frequently contributed to the photo magazines , but it was not adopted for a long time .
His great - grandson , <unk> TOKUGAWA , was also a freelance camera , and his photographs were found in the house of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA , including Yoshinobu 's filming , and they were organized and compiled .
It was the younger brother of Akitake TOKUGAWA , who was a friend of a person 's hobbies .
She married Mikako ICHIJO on December 3 , 1856 ( changed her name to Mikako after the Meiji Restoration ) .
His eldest daughter ( <unk> <unk> ) was born on July 16 , 1858 , but died young on July 20 .
Since then , he had no children with <unk> , and all 10 sons and 11 daughters born in the Meiji period were born between them and two concubines .
The seven sons , <unk> , who became a prince and succeeded the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family , and 10 sons , <unk> , who became an adopted son - in - law of Kaishu KATSU , <unk> , and Keishi , who became the wife of Fushimi no Miya Prince Hiroyasu .
Princess Kikuko , the wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito , and so on , were children of <unk> .
His lawful wife was Mikako ICHIJO ( changed his name to Mikako ) ( from July 19 , 1842 to July 9 , 1894 ) .

Note
Nara <unk> is a railway line ( main line ) of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) , which runs from Kizu Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) to Kyoto Station in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
The entire line is included in the large urban suburban section .
Because the history of the Kansai Main Line has been established as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , the formal starting station is Kizu Station , but the trains that go from Kyoto Station to Kizu Station ( the number number of trains is odd ) and the opposite side ( even even in the same ) are the inbound train .
Except for the route data , the following items are specified : For the direction of Kizu from Kyoto to Kizu .
The color of the line is brown ( <unk> ) , and the reason for selecting is that ' the image of Classic of Ancient Capital connecting two ancient capitals . '
Jurisdiction ( business type ): West Japan Railway Company ( railway operator )
Railway distance ( operating kilometers ): <unk> km
Track gauge : 1067 mm
Number of stations : 19 ( including the starting and last stations )
Double - tracked section : Shinden - Uji section , JR Fujinomori - Kyoto section
Electrified section : entire line electrified ( DC1500V )
Block system ( railway ) : automatic block system ( double - track section ) , single - track automatic block system ( single - track section )
Safety device : Automatic Train Stop device
Operation Center : Shin - Osaka General Control Center
Maximum speed : 110 km / h ( double track section ) , 95 km / h ( single track section )
Except for Kizu Station , Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto Branch of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) Kyoto Branch ( Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of West Japan Railway Company ) .
Although the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line , the entire line is located in Kyoto Prefecture and there is no route in Nara Prefecture .
This was originally constructed by the Nara Railway , but was separated from the Kizu - south section as a part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the merger of the Kansai Railway Company .
However , the trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station in Nara Prefecture by entering the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) .
After the revision of March 13 , 1988 , the JR West established a nickname for each line of the Urban Network ( such as the JR Kyoto Line and the JR Kobe Line ) , but the Nara Line was sent to the Nara Line .
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is also located on the Kintetsu Nara Line , it is sometimes referred to as ' JR Nara Line . '
In the era of Japan National Railways , it was guided by ' the Nara Line of Japan National Railways ' and the English notation of the guide board was also used .
The Kintetsu Nara Line is related to the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is in a rival relationship .
While many trains of the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel with the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated since the past , the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 at the end of the JNR National Railways , and even after the electrification , only two local trains of the JNR Series 105 cars ran on a small track .
However , after the inauguration of JR West , the operation of the trains was made into four - car trains ( six - car trains ) , double - track trains , and rapid trains , including ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and so on , were rapidly improved .
At present , it has a strong character as a commuter and school route from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture , such as Uji City , and Joyo City , which are along the line .
However , the section between Momoyama Station and Shinden Station , which runs on the east side of the line , has a gap between the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and the areas that run in parallel with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , which runs in parallel with the central part of the town .
Although the cars are used by the Nara Train Yard of the Osaka branch , the facilities of the station are managed by the Kyoto branch , except for Kizu Station .
J - Through , ICOCA , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , and PiTaPa of Surutto KANSAI can be used at all stations .
The simplified ticket gates are also provided in the section south of Joyo Station .
Since the Express ' Kuroshio ' , which had been connected by the Nara Line , Sakurai Line , and Wakayama Line , was abolished in 1984 , only local trains were operated by local trains until 1991 ( as for limited express trains , special express trains were operated temporarily for a while ) , and four types of local trains are currently operated .
It is the most rapid type of the Nara Line and is operated mainly in the daytime .
Basically , the train makes a connection with a local train at Uji Station with a local train at Uji Station .
The nickname of ' Miyako <unk> Rapid Service ' was decided by the general public before the start of the operation .
It is often used as a train connecting Kyoto and Nara , not only by Japanese people but also by tourists .
All the trains are operated by the JR West Series 221 and are operated with four cars or six cars .
In the double - track section , the maximum speed is 110 km / h , and other trains are 95 km / h .
The standard time for the required time is about 44 minutes from Kyoto , and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Kyoto .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station for two minutes , and therefore , the inbound train and outbound trains go to Nara Station , and the required time is slightly different from the Miyakoji Rapid Service .
During the three - three days of the new year , the Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari - inari Station .
History
March 3 , 2001 : The operation started .
March 15 , 2003 : Due to the timetable revision , the train began to stop at Tofuku - ji Station and Tamamizu Station .
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours .
The trains stop at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) , which pass the ' Miyako Rapid Service . '
All the 221 series are operated with four cars or six cars .
Basically , the train makes a connection with a local train at Uji Station with a local train at Uji Station .
Like the above Miyako Rapid Service , Narayama Station , where rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line stop , runs nonstop .
Until March 2001 when the ' Miyako <unk> Rapid Service ' appeared , the stops of the JNR 117 electric trains were used for the trains of Kyoto , Uji , Joyo ( initially passed ) , Kizu and Nara , but since then , they were not used on the Nara Line .
In the morning and evening , trains run directly to the Yamatoji Line due to the convenience of the operation .
It is operated mainly in the morning and night .
At first , the timetable was revised on March 18 , 2006 , but it was also operated on Saturdays and holidays .
Although the trains stop at each station between Uji Station and Nara Station , in the past , there was a regional rapid train heading for Uji Station for the direction of Kizu Station in order to pass down local trains at Uji Station during the late night , but now , the local trains running on the local trains run in the section were changed to the final stop at this station .
One train departing from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays uses the JNR 103 series Series 103 and all trains that run on the 221 series .
In the morning rush hours , trains run directly from the Yamatoji Line for the convenience of the operation .
The Nara Line used the same color as the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and the same orange color as the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' to prevent the <unk> of the Yamatoji Line , but the timetable was revised in March 2008 , due to the timetable revision , the timetable was revised , and the section of the regional rapid trains came to be used as a green line , and the line of the section was not used as a color .
The timetable on which the station is located north of Kamikoma Station is written with purple letters .
It is operated between Kyoto and Uji , Joyo , and Nara .
During the daytime , the section between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station is operated every 15 minutes , but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station becomes a 30 - minute interval .
Basically , the cars are operated on the 103 series , but they are operated with some 221 series .
In the early morning and late evening , there are some trains that run directly to the Yamatoji Line in the morning and late evening .
In the past , there were some direct trains with the Sakurai Line , but the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines due to the timetable revision on September 4 , 1994 .
Although it was a special train , limited express trains were also operated on the Nara Line .
From 1987 to 1988 , the ' Kuroshio ' was used as the nickname of the JNR / JR Limited Express Limited Express 381 electric train from 1988 to 1989 , and the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line , the Hanwa Line , and the Hanwa Line were operated via the Hanwa Line .
In the Kinki edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun on January 6 , 1998 , there was a report that the operation of the limited express train was announced to the Nara Line ( as a regular train ) in 2001 , but the plan was suspended .
It was once operated between Kyoto and Sakurai ( between Kyoto and Nara ) as the Miyako Miyako Leisure Line , but the direct trains were n't operated on the Sakurai Line including temporary trains .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Festival , which is the nearest train to Uji Station , is held , but the train is operated during special schedule from 16 to 16:00 , and after 16 , all local trains run between Kyoto Station and Uji Station for 10 minutes .
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station .
At the time of the first three days of the new year , the special timetable of the new year was made , and the rapid train stopped at every station between Kyoto Station and Uji Station , and the number of trains was increased to increase the number of trains .
Depending on the year , some trains were set up on the shuttle trains returning to Momoyama Station .
Around 1992 , the direct train to the Sakurai Line was extended to Tenri Station , mainly on Saturdays and holidays , and the special rapid train was operated for one hour .
In addition , special trains are sometimes available from all over Japan .
In particular , during the Tenri <unk> Festival on October 26 every year , the trains called ' exclusive train bound for the group ' run from Kyoto Station to Tenri Station via the Nara Line and the Yamatoji Line between Nara Station and Nara Station and Sakurai Line .
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot .
JR West Suburban Train Series 221
The Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line are commonly used , and there are two - car trains , four - car trains and six - car trains .
It is mainly used for four - car trains and six - car trains in the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and ' Rapid Service , ' but four - car trains run on the Nara Line .
Two - car trains are connected with two - car trains on holidays .
JNR / JR Commuter Train Series 103
The 103 series 103 cars used for local trains on the Nara Line are operated only by the Nara Line , and they are combined with two cars , and are also operated on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during rush hour .
Some of the cars were transferred from Morinomiya Train Depot on the Osaka Loop Line .
Although the Nara Railway started operating between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station , the line between Kyoto Station and Momoyama Station , the present - day Kintetsu Kyoto Line , started operating the route of the present - day Kyoto Line .
On the day of 1921 when the section between Baba ( currently Zeze Station ) on the Tokaido Main Line and Kyoto Station via Higashiyama Tunnel was replaced by the current line , the new line between the former Tokaido Main Line and Inari Station and the section between Kyoto Station and Inari Station became the Nara Line , and the section between Kyoto and Fushimi became a freight line , and the section between Fushimi and Momoyama became a freight line .

In addition , along the National Route 24 between JR - JR - Fujinomori Station and Momoyama Station , the Keihan Uji Line , which runs between Kohata Station and Uji Station ( near Obaku Station ) , are located in a difficult section .
Because of the shortage of budget , it is possible that the Sagano Line ( between the Sanin Main Line and Sonobe Station ) would have been promoted at least , and after the entire line became a double - tracked line .

Keiji Bypass ( <unk> ) is a bypass of general National Highway Road that runs from Kusatsu City , Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama - cho , Kuse County , Kyoto Prefecture .
It was designated as a local standard project .
The Keiji Bypass , which is a toll road , will be described as follows : The Keiji Bypass of National Highway 1 and the National Highway Route No . 24 will be described as follows :
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway and connects with the Otsu City and Kyoto City area , and connects with the Ritto Interchange , Nagoya City , Suita Interchange , and Osaka City area .
According to the law , the <unk> Interchange and the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange are the National Highway 1 - National Highway Route No . 478 , the Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama - Yodo Junction - the Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama - Yodo Junction - the Kumiyama - sen Junction - the National Highway Road ( National Highway Highway Road exclusive ) - the high - standard highway ( Kyoto Jukan Jukan Jidoshado Expressway / Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) - the Kumiyama - Kumiyama - Yodo Junction - the Kumiyama - kokudo Jidoshado Expressway ( Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) - the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange ( Chuo Expressway ) , the Kumiyama Expressway ( National Highway II ) , and the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange are the names of the Kumiyama Expressway ( Chuo Expressway ) .
In the later project , the Kyoto Daini Daini - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - soto - doro was established , because it was necessary to improve the congestion of the Meishin Expressway and Kyoto City .
The Kyoto Jukan Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway are designated as National Route 478 and have consistently been maintained .
In the indication of the route , it is considered to be the Keiji Bypass in Seta Junction - Oyamazaki Junction , which is easier to understand by users .
In addition , even if the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass pass pass through either of them , the fare fee and the ETC discount system are not different .
If otherwise specified , the Keiji Bypass ( from the Seta - higashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki Junction ) , which is a commercial name , will be described .

Oyamazaki Interchange / JCT - Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange
The Uji Tunnel of this route is the longest tunnel among the National Route 1 , and the tunnel is forbidden to change the lane except for the Uji - higashi Interchange and the Kasatori Interchange .
Before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction , the film " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " was shot .
Seta - higashi Interchange - The distance of Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT is slightly shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and if the Keiji Bypass runs at the highest speed , it is more accessible to the destination via Keiji Bypass .
Because there are no rest space in the service area , the Meishin Expressway is crowded with Meishin Expressway ( there are two locations in the Otsu Service Area and the Katsura Parking Area ) .
However , the structure was established by the <unk> of Seta and Oyamazaki Junction ( especially the structure of Oyamazaki Junction became extremely complicated ) , and therefore , the <unk> ( highway ) was reduced to the lower part of the <unk> ( highway ) .
If you go to the direction of Suita Junction and the Osaka area , there is a fault that if you go to the direction of Suita and Osaka , the Meishin Expressway Route is joined , the traffic jams may occur .
In addition , since there are many drivers who want to avoid such curves and slopes on the way , they do not function sufficiently as a bypass of Meishin Expressway .
This road is also a bypass of National Highway 1 ( National Highway ) , and is an exclusive highway for automobiles and is not a highway .
If you pass the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka , you must go to the west of the Uji - gawa River .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is half - IC .
For this reason , the section between the Uji - higashi Interchange and the Uji - nishi Interchange is often congested .
Because this general road section is not connected to the <unk> , it is difficult to avoid traffic congestion .

Higashi Hongan - ji Temple , located in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture , is a Buddhist temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect .
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Shinshu sect ( the ten schools of the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) and is the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu Sect along with the Nishi Hongan - ji Temple ( formally the head temple of the Hongan - ji School of the Jodo Shinshu Sect ) .
The formal temple name was ' Hongan - ji Temple ' until 1987 and ' Shinshu Honbyo Mausoleum ' after the same year .
It is often called ' <unk> - san ' because it is distinguished from Nishi Hongan - ji Temple located in the same Shimogyo Ward .
( Refer to the section of the History of Hongan - ji Temple for details on the history of the period before the split into east and west . )
Kyonyo ( Mitsutoshi ) , the twelfth chief priest of Hongan - ji Temple , was given the temple 's estate on the east side of Hongan - ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , and when Hongan - ji Temple was split into two temples in 1602 , Kyonyo founded Kyonyo .
The temple was located at Shichijo , Karasuma , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , and was named Higashi Hongan - ji Temple because it was located in the east of Nishi Hongan - ji Temple located at Horikawa Shichijo , Horikawa Shichijo .
In 1987 , Hongan - ji Temple as a religious corporation , which had been integrated with Otani School , was legally dissolved as a religious corporation , and was integrated with the sect .
After that , the formal name of Higashi Hongan - ji Temple became ' Shinshu Honbyo ' ( ' Hon - honbyo Mausoleum ' means the fundamental dojo ( training hall ) , which the followers of <unk> accompanied Shinran who heard Shinran 's teaching of the sect .
It also means to distinguish it from the Hongan - ji school of the Jodo Shinshu sect , which was a branch of the Jodo Shinshu sect , and to insist on legitimacy .
Refer to the East Riot .
In the Edo period , four fires were destroyed by fire , and many of the existing buildings were reconstructed during the Meiji period after the Dondon - yake , but the architecture and wall paintings of the time were attracted by the sophisticated techniques of those days .
The Goei - do hall , which enshrines the statue of Shinran Shonin , is the largest wooden building in the world ( currently covered with the roof ) .
The Goei - mon Gate is one of the three great gates of the Sammon Gate .
It owns Shinran 's own handwriting , " <unk> shinjitsu shinjitsu shinjitsu shinjitsu shinjitsu shinjitsu shinjitsu kyogyo kyogyo kyogyo <unk> " ( National Treasures ) ( Bando - bon ) .

Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is a god ( humanized god ) appearing in Japanese Mythology .
In " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) is called ' <unk> ' when she was enshrined as a natural deity .
It is a god who deified the sun and is considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial Family .
In " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is described as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
It is also called <unk> no Kami or <unk> no Kami .
In the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there are several names , while " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) describes that the name of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' was unified in the shinmei ( name of a god ) .
Although it is a goddess , there is also another theory that he was a male god .
As the shinmei ( name of god ) of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as " Kotai Kotai Kotai - jingu <unk> " ( the list of Kotai Kotai - jingu Shrine ) , there is a theory that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no Mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Imperial Family , and that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no Mikoto ) was the ancestor of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and became Amaterasu Omikami .
In Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , or Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , or Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and when they chant the name in the Shinto rituals , they are also referred to as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
In academic documents , ' Amaterasu ' and ' Kana ' ( Japanese syllabary characters ) are practiced at present .
There is a theory that it was written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) in ancient times .
Description in mythology
According to " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , when Izanagi returned from the Yominokuni ( the land of the dead ) where Izanami lived , she was born when she washed her left eye .
At that time , he was called Mihashira no uzuno miko ( three children ) along with Tsukuyomi , who was born from the right eye , and Susano who was born from his nose .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to govern Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susano , who was entrusted with the ocean , cried in tears , saying that he wanted to go to Nenokuni ( the land of the Roots ) where Izanami was , so he was expelled by Izanagi .
Susanoo went up to Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) to meet his older sister Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) before he went to Nenokuni , but Amaterasu Omikami thought that his younger brother came from Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and waited for him .
In order to prove Susano 's innocence , Susano made a pledge to prove Susano 's innocence , and a five - god god god god from Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Susano 's real god , and Susano 's three female gods were born from the fact that Susano was born , and Susano declared his victory .
The following five gods were born from the fact of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and the children of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
<unk>
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo , who was pleased with this , made a violent act in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amaterasu Omikami hid in Ama no iwato ( Cave of heaven ) .
The world became in the darkness and various misfortunes occurred .
( Eight million gods , including <unk> no mikoto , the god of the Chichibu - no - kami ( God of Wisdom ) , and <unk> no mikoto , succeeded in making Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) from Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and Susano was expelled from Takamanohara ( the Plain of High Heaven ) .
He descended to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) and sent Amatsu kami ( heavenly god ) .
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni was subdued , Amenooshihomimi finally came to earth , but Ninigi 's grandson Ninigi was born , so Ninigi descended to Ninigi .
<unk> interpretation
In the mythology , there is a scene where Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) prayed to the god of heaven ( Takamimusubi ) , who was born earlier than him , or followed the instructions , so Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is considered to have been deified as the Emperor who ruled the country by performing religious services ( religious services ) .
There is also a view that it was a divinity of a shrine maiden in ancient times .
The other name ' <unk> ' is ' Hi no onna ' ( a woman of the sun ) and is a shrine maiden serving the sun god .
Although the sun god was originally a male god , there is a theory that a shrine maiden who served it was equated with the sun god and became a goddess .
Also , there is a theory that this goddess was established around the time of Empress Jito , who was the empress , or that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
The birth of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Tsukuyomi , the sun of the sun , and moon of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is pointed out to have a strong influence on Dokyo , saying ' the sun of the sun , the sun , the sun , the sun , and the sun of the sun , and the moon ' ( before the sixth century ) , and ' the eyes of the left and the sun are the sun of the sun and the moon , and the moon are the sun of the sun . '
It is also said that the word of the word , such as Okami ( great god ) of Ise - jingu Shrine that enshrines Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , jingu Shrine , Saigu ( Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise - jingu Shrine ) , <unk> no Miya ( <unk> ) , Murasaki no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Toyouke no Okami , are combined with Taoism .
In comparison , there is pointed out that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and others were almost identical with the <unk> myth , which has been recorded in the older period ( three to fourth centuries ) .
Since it is a universal <unk> which spread throughout Asia , there is also a theory that it was a myth that spread to Japan along with people in the prehistoric times .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the divinity changed into three stages .
The following is a summary of the incident and the contents of the incident , which is the turning point .
645 : Taika Reforms
The Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami before this time .
The word ' kami ' is used for the sun .
A male god named ' <unk> ' was enshrined widely .
In " Engishiki " ( codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines that read ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' such as ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima , ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Harima Province and ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Tanba .
In addition , <unk> is another name for Amenohoakari , a grandson of Amaterasu , and Amenohoakari is also the founder of the Owari clan , Tsumori clan , and Amabe clan .
The younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi and was a great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : Jinshin War .
It is called ' <unk> no <unk> ' or ' <unk> no <unk> ' or ' <unk> no <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In this case , there is an interpretation that the enshrined deity is <unk> no <unk> , and it is interpreted as ' <unk> ' of male gods .
698 : It was founded by the Kotai - jingu Shrine .
Amaterasu ' and ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family . '
A goddess .
It was created by the nature god as a model for Empress Jito .
After that , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) other than the Imperial Family was called ' <unk> ' ( the Sun Goddess ) .
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( around 1060 ) , the part of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' is read as ' <unk> ' and also in ' <unk> ' in " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
1880 - 1881 , over the enshrined deity of Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto clerical bureau ) in Hibiya , Tokyo , a religious dispute arose in the Shinto religion .
The Shinto Jimukyoku decided to enshrine the four gods of creation ( Ame no Minakanushi no Kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Kamimusubi no kami ) and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) as the enshrined deity in the shrine of the clerical bureau , but ' Izumo - ha ' ( the Izumo school ) insisted that the enshrined deity should be enshrined in the heavenly realm ( the same as the other world ) and the god of the divine world ( the same as that of the world ) , and the god of the divine world ( the world ) should be governed by five deities ( the other world ) .
However , the ' Ise - ha ' ( the Ise school ) , which was in charge of the center of the Shinto Jimukyoku , was ' the supreme leader of the heaven and earth ' that Amaterasu Omikami ruled Ryokai Ryokai ( the Two Realms Realms ) , and other gods insisted that they were too too loyal to them , and the both sides opposed each other .
In the end , there were various rumors such as ' The Izumo school of the Izumo - ha ( Izumo school of Buddhism ) has a long time ago , ' ' and ' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
Later , this dispute was settled by the decision of Emperor Meiji ( the Izumo school was defeated ) , and the divinity of Amaterasu Omikami was ranked at the highest rank .
It is said that the government acknowledged the possibility of the creation of the creed system common to Shinto , and that the modern nation recognized the possibility that the modern nation directly controlled the people through the restoration Shinto teachings .
Refer to a dispute over the enshrined deity of State Shinto Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto Jimukyoku ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA used " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , another name of " <unk> " ( <unk> ) in his own novel , when Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) appeared .
This is because the name ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) came to appear in the following sentences , so the sun god and the nature of the nature god would be called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In fact , in the novel of Akutagawa , there were many cases in which he could not correct , corrections , corrections , corrections , and corrections by the command of the army .
<unk> YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who founded <unk> Gakuin in 1926 , said ' Japan has faith in Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amaterasu Omikami is an ideal to <unk> the world of Japanese spirit .
The ideal of Izanami and Izanagi 's ' <unk> ' is to say , in other words , it is an ideal to go to the world of the world , to become a pioneer , a pioneer , and a leader . '
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami are called Shinmei - jinja Shrine , and all over the country are in the Naiku ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) of Ise - jingu Shrine ( Ise Jingu Shrine ) .
The Kotai - jingu Shrine is a Shinto shrine that enshrines one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family , Yata no Kagami ( Yata no Kagami ) , one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family .
At most shrines throughout Japan , the talisman ( taima ) of Kotai - jingu Shrine ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) was distributed .
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) was a term derived from a large - scale village headman .
It refers to a great number of people who were named <unk> .
Shomyo is a shomyo ( a Buddhist name ) .
He said that he had a strong power in the region .
In the samurai society , the word came to mean a samurai who owned many shoryo ( territory ) and subordinates .
In the Muromachi period , shugo strengthened their control over their territories and became shugo daimyo ( provincial military governor ) .
In the Sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , a powerful feudal lord who established a strong control of his own territory appeared and was called Kokujin ( local samurai ) and Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period ) .
In the Edo period , it became a word referring to samurai families that were given more than 10,000 koku ( approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield ) by the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
Among the samurai who were less than 10,000 koku , samurai who were under the direct control of the bakufu were called direct retainers .
Daimyo were called daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) because they shared the character of feudal lord and the character of feudal lords in China , and they were called daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) .
This section explains the details of the early - modern daimyo in the Edo period .
Refer to the article for the Shugo daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) and the Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) .
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) in the Edo period
Daimyo in the Edo period were determined by their social standing , official ranks , ranks , positions , and shikoseki ( anteroom seats for feudal lords ) .
At first , the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family was divided into hereditary daimyo ( a hereditary vassal ) who were vassals of the Tokugawa family ( shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , Shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , Shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , Shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , and Tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) who had been vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara .
When the shogun Ieyasu died out , the first Shogun , established the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was permitted to use the surname of Tokugawa as well as to support the shogun 's control , and in the same sense , the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA was allowed to use the Tokugawa family , and the eleventh son of Yorinobu TOKUGAWA , the 11th son of Kishu Domain , Yorifusa TOKUGAWA , and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA of Mito Domain .
In addition , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of Ieyasu and the second son of Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to Echizen Domain , and established a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) of the Tokugawa family throughout the country .
In addition , he placed fudai daimyo ( a hereditary vassal ) who established the period of the Tokugawa Shogun family as fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu as a fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) , and in addition , he was appointed as an important post mainly in the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) such as Tairo ( chief minister ) and roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) , as well as in securing the military power of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and made him decide to the shogunate government .
The fudai daimyo were relatively low , and besides , the Torii clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , the Honda clan , and the Ogasawara clan were relatively <unk> , but the fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who maintained 100,000 koku ( approximately 100,000 million liters of crop yield ) in the Edo period , including the Sakai clan , the Hotta clan , the Hotta clan , the Yanagisawa clan , and the Toda clan .
This led to the separation of power and military power .
After the Battle of Sekigahara , tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) were subordinated to the Tokugawa family , and many families were opposed to the Tokugawa family in Sekigahara .
The bakufu was very cautious about the bakufu and actively engaged in intelligence activities by spy , and if there was fear of illegal activities and rebellion , they were strictly punished by being deprived of their fief .
As a representative tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) of the Maeda clan , the Kaga Domain of the Maeda clan , the Sendai Domain of the Shimazu clan , the Fukuoka Domain of the Kuroda clan , the Hiroshima Domain , the Choshu Domain of the Mori clan , the Aizu clan , the Aizu clan , the Aizu clan , the Aizu clan , the Aizu clan , the Mori clan , the Aizu clan , the Aizu clan , the Yonezawa Domain , the Yonezawa Domain , the Nabeshima clan of the Saga Domain , the Hosokawa clan , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , and the Satake clan of the Okayama Domain , as well as the Satake clan of the Okayama Domain .
In addition , when daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) had to have a territory equivalent to a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) or more than one province , a daimyo ( feudal lord ) who had a castle with a lord ( joshukaku ) or a castle with a castle was distinguished from a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) or jinya ( regional government office ) , and the daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) in Edo - jo Castle ordered them to reside in Edo - jo Castle to serve as a room .
For more information , refer to " shikoseki . "
In spite of the level of daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) , the daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) with 100,000 koku were not allowed to possess a total of 100,000 koku , and most of them had territories around the castle town and spots .
In extreme cases , one village was divided into another feudal lord ( <unk> ) .
Daimyo were generally more than 10,000 koku , but the Kitsuregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was 5,000 koku .
This is because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan .
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of Buke Shohatto ( Laws for the Military Houses ) and Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In addition , they were also ordered to defend the seashore at the end of the Edo period , and daimyo were always in financial difficulties .
