There is also a theory that he was a son of Michichika 's son , MINAMOTO no Michimune or Michimitsu KOGA .

In 1253 , he handed over Eihei - ji Temple to his disciple Ejo , and died at the age of 54 at the age of 54 at the time of his secular disciple Kakuen at the residence of his disciple Kakuen ( Takakura - dori Street , Kyoto City ) .
The cause of his death is said to have been a cryster .
Even if a certain level of Jobutsu was not completed by a certain level of time , even if it became a Buddha , it was a true practice for the ascetic practices to keep the ascetic practices of Buddha ( Shuichi Ichinyo , the true nature of the Buddha ) , and that it was the ultimate practice of sitting meditation , which was the highest practice of sitting meditation .
Many of the Kamakura Buddhism are positively recognized as the Mappo Shiso ( theory of the end of the world ) , but the record of the Shosobogenzo - ki ( record of the record of the Buddhist Statues ) says that this word is not completely different from the fact that it is the origin of this word .
It is a convenient for a while while holding the end of the statue of the Buddha in Buddhism and is convenient for a while .
The true teaching of Sanezane is not accepted .
It should be the best to be the same .
It is not necessarily the case that he won all his life in his lifetime .
There are some cases where they are illuminated and they are in a light of their heart , and they are also called " Asama Shikishin " or " Shimen . "
The precepts of Buddhism and various kinds of precepts are given to all living things and the people who are in the lower root are given to the people who are in charge of the precepts of Buddhism and the like .
It is the opportunity for all people to be a Buddha .
If you do not have any weapons , you should always always have to do so as to do so , and if you do you do you do so , the end of the method is merely a convenient one , it is denied that the last method should be a mere way of preaching .

Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a facility for preservation of steam locomotives operated by the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) in Kankiji - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
On October 10 , 1972 , Japan National Railway 's 100th anniversary of the establishment of Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) was established in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , and steam locomotives that had been supported by Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) were regarded as valuable cultural properties , and they were the first facility for the purpose of preservation .
In 1987 , JR West took over the division and privatization of JNR .
This facility is the current vehicle ( Umekoji Operation ) of the company , and is also conducted as an inspecting and repairing of the JNR D1010 locomotive owned by Sagano Scenic Railway Co. , Ltd. as well as the Japan National Railways .
In the first place , this facility became the beginning of the establishment of this facility , and it was because it was to preserve steam locomotives rapidly from the latter half of the 1960s .
At first , the Oyama - ku Ward located in Oyama , Tochigi Prefecture was the most candidate for preservation and the site of the preservation institution , but it was officially selected as a preservation institution in 1970 because it was located near the capital 's capital area , because it was located in the ' central part of Japan . '
In principle , the cars for preservation were examined to select the existing cars ( if it is possible to be the first one can be used , but there are some cars that were not preserved at the beginning .
The facilities are composed of " Steam Locomotive Exhibition Hall , " which utilizes the former Umekoji institution and the bicycle type , and " Historical Materials Exhibition Hall , " which was reconstructed and reconstructed by the former Nijo residence of the former Nijo family .
The Ogata Kuri was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914 and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the five tentative ceiling , the ceiling , the ceiling , and the Hikomi Line were designated as national important cultural properties .
In the same year , in 2004 , he was selected as a national heritage of the Civil Engineering Academy .

Although the Kyoto Railway was nationalized in 1907 , it was used as the station building of JR West after that , but in 1996 , it was replaced by the construction of the Sanin Main Line between Nijo Station and Hanazono Station on the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) , and the station building was reconstructed as a station building , and the interior of the station building was used as a relay site of the former building in 1997 .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
In Ogata Kuri ( Ogata House ) , 16 domestic steam locomotives produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period were installed and exhibited on display as a display of 16 ryo ( 16 ryo at the beginning of the opening ) .
At the beginning of the opening , the motivation was basically preserved and there were 15 cars of C53 series and C51 cars of C51 and 2399 , but it has been carried out several times after that , and the storage machine has been a seven - car car car for preservation .
Among them , the five cars are registered even now , and two cars ( C557 cars and C5551 and C5516 ) are served on the Yamaguchi Line as ' Yamaguchi ' and ' Hokiwako ( train ) ' on the Hokuriku Main Line .
Although there are no taxis for the preservation machines other than these two cars , the trains are not investigated , so they can not run on the Tokaido Main Line because they do not have any inspection in all directions .
In addition , the ' SL Squom ' is operated by the track of the railway in the vicinity of the museum , which is a storage machine for exhibitions .
This exhibition line was once located north of the depot and was used to be a large - size parking parking area ( once a rest facility and a parking facility in the old residence was located in the vicinity of the station , but it was changed to the north of the former Nijo Station and the current Umekoji Park south of the Sagano Line .
Even now , it has a function as a institute and is also connected to the business line .
Furthermore , after the Takadori factory of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) was closed , steam locomotives were also developed .

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music .
It is a religious music used for rituals and ceremonies .
In Japan , it is also called Bonbai or Bonbon - zori .
In the old style , it was written as " myo " in the Chinese character " myo " ( 正 ) .
It is one of the studies of ancient India , and is one of the five ancient India .
The Five Ming , which means the category of the five kinds of vocational schools , refers to the five categories of Shomyo ( vocational schools , the art of the Chinese language , the study of the art of the Chinese language ) , the technique of engineering and technology , the medical science ( medical science , the medical science , the study of the ethics of one 's own sect ) , the Inmei ( ethical teacher ) , and Naimei ( Buddhist ) .
Along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan , it became popular in Japan .
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in 754 when the Great Buddha of Todai - ji Temple was held during the Kaigen hoyo ( a ceremony to consecrate the eyes of the dead ) held in 754 , and it is believed that Shomyo was popular in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai handed down the voice and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo .
Other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect , there are unique voices of each sect and even today the school has been handed down to the present day .
Because the voice was handed down in Kuden , the music music was not used .
For this reason , the denju was difficult to do so .
Later , hakase , which was the Gakufu ( musical instrument ) , was invented .
There are differences in terms of specialized terms such as hakase depending on each school .
However , hakase were a referee to recite Shomyo and if they were to learn Shomyo ( Shomyo in Japanese ) , they needed to teach the Kuden ( or Guden ) ( i.e. Roi ( supporter ) , and they could not maintain and inherit the school from the master to disciples .
For this reason , the training of the leaders and successors was required to be necessary .
Many schools were abolished due to various conditions .

Before long , two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the dojo for Shomyo of the Ohara school .
In addition , Jakuren later became a group of schools , and in Ohara there was a voice of two groups .
Later , Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo .
The school was based on a new music theory .
Since then , the center of the Tendai Shomyo sect has been passed down to the present Tendai Shomyo .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu sect and the Jodo Shinshu sect voices the Jodo Shinshu sect are the lineage of the Tendai Shomyo sect .
Shingon - Shomyo is the basis of the transmission of Kukai and has been handed down to the present day .
It has been after the Shinga period when Shomyo has been systematized .
Kancho can be said to be the restorer of the family .
He served as composer and improvement of Shomyo ( Shomyo era ) .
Although there were many schools until the Kamakura period , it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho , by four schools ( Honsoin school , Shingonin , Daigo - ryu , Nakagawa Daishinryu ) .
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined during the Edo period and disappeared from the Edo period .
The Honsoin school and the Shinkoin - ryu and Daigo schools were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
Currently , it is divided into Chizan ( Chishaku - in Temple , Kyoto ) and Buzan ( Nagatanji - Temple ) , and Nanzan Shinryu ( Nanzan school ) ( Nara ) , and Nanzan school ( Higashiyama Ward , Kyoto and Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The Ryomei school originated from the Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo ( Shomyo Shomyo of Shingi Shingon sect ) of the Shingon sect Chizan school and the Buzan school of the Shingon sect Buzan School , and the Ming , both of them originated from the Nakagawa Daishin school .

The characteristic is that it is called ' ronronron ' ( 論論論 ) of Mt. Toyama , ' ron ' ( 論論論 ) and ' shomyo ' ( 明明 ) of Mt. Chizan ( Mt. Chizan .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school of the Nanzan Shingon - shu sect ( Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect ) was the origin of the Nakagawa school .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa Temple in Nara Prefecture .
In 1232 to 1233 , he moved his base to Rengeidani and Sanbo - in Temple to Mt. Koya .

Emperor Tenchi had the first prince Prince Otomo succeed to the throne , and the Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) tells that he had the first prince Otomo succeed to the throne .

Brief Personal Personal Profile
Empress Suiko ( 626 - born in 626 ) was born .
Imperial Prince Sadanaru ( July 12 , 645 to July 12 , 645 ) - He was formally installed as Crown Prince .
Saimei July 24 , 661 - Shosei
On February 20 , 668 , he succeeded to the throne .
January 7 , 672 - He died at the age of 46 .
( " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) says that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated in the mountains because he died of illness after the death of a disease , and there is a theory that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated by the Emperor Tenmu because he said that the Emperor was not able to do so because he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was going to return to the mountain where he was in the palanquin in of the Emperor and the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the place of the mountain
It is one of the mysteries of political history in the middle of the seventh century , Emperor Tenchi did not ascend the throne for a long time and was one of the most likely examples of the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .
There are several theories about this theory .
This is the consideration for the power of the Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , Emperor Tenmu , who was believed to have been a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , is wrong , and it is said that Emperor Tenmu was the Emperor Han , who was born before the Empress Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei , and he was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi .
It is certain that the year of Emperor Tenmu was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) and some history books of the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) at the age of the Emperor Tenmu , and Emperor Tenmu was appointed as the longer .
However , there are no contradictory contradictions between the same historical materials , and there are many historical materials that contain the difference between the age of eight and nine years older than the age of 8 .
On the other hand , there is an opinion that the Emperor Tenmu was in the age of 16 in the age of his father Emperor Jomei because his older brother was bad and his younger brother was not good and he intentionally wrote in the ' Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) ' that " he was the age of his father , Emperor Jomei who was the age of his father , Emperor Jomei .
Therefore , the year of his birth is 614 , which is the year of the birth of the Emperor Honcho was adopted , and it is said that he was born in 614 when he was born .
In fact , he was not rare in ancient times , and he also had the title of Tenchi and Michiko who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu 's reign , and did not ascend to the throne .
It is said that there was a misconception in order to avoid the error .
There is a theory that the history books which are pointed out as ' Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) ' are different from the fact that it was compiled in the same period as the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) are not treated as the same .
( Refer to the article on the age of Emperor Tenmu . )
It is said that the Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat of Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Naka no Oe was driven from the position .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good and it has been pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of the policy .
If Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji killed Iruka .
In addition , this theory has been advocated because the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki were revised and revised and the Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) has been accepted .
In this theory , the reason for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka did not be expelled after the coup d'etat and there are many doubts about other doubtful .
There is a theory that the enthronement was delayed due to the opposition from the relationship between the women of the Emperor Tenji .
It is said that Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , showed the unfair relationship between her and Tenchi in the poem that was written in the same way as his wife and a daughter of the Emperor Tenchi ( Tenchi no Ma no Himemiko 's younger sister ) .
Although the love and marriage between her half brother and sisters were allowed to be allowed to be forgiven , she was actually in love with the older brother of the same mother , but it was interpreted that she was actually involved in the Tenru ( a rainy rain ) of the Satonaka era and even after she got married to her uncle , she was furious about the relationship between her uncle , Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
After the death of Empress Saimei , the Imperial Princess Hashihito succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous Emperor , but there is a theory that the records were lost due to some circumstances .
It is said that this is because the theory that the Emperor was the Imperial princess of the Imperial Family and the Emperor could be the heir to the throne until the enthronement of the Emperor Tenji .
If Hashihito no Himemiko = ' Naka no Mikoto , ' the reason why she was called ' Nakanomikoto ' can be considered to be a special reason for her being called ' Chuo , ' but there is a theory that it is not clear whether she was Empress Saimei .
Although it is difficult to prove the nature of political history and historical materials , it is difficult to prove it , and the study of the study has been progressed , including the cooperation of archaeologists and so on .

He was from the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan , and his family status was Seiga ( the second highest family status for court nobles ) .
The Toin family and the Imadegawa family ( the Kikutei family ) were divided into the Saionji family .
In addition , the Saionji clan , a powerful branch of the Saionji clan , in Iyo Province , used the family name of Saionji , as a branch of the Saionji clan .
The family crest is made of the left trips .
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane .
Since Michisue 's great - grandchild Kintsune SAIONJI had a niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo as his wife , he was caught by the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and was confined to the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and after the Jokyu War , he gained the power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi ( liaison between the Kanto and the Kanto regions ) and gained the social status of Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) .
The name of the Saionji family comes from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his villa in Kyoto ( Kitayama - mura , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono Palace , and the current Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA , who was transferred from the Saionji family .

Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) , and he put his daughter to the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
However , after his son , Kinhira SAIONJI , the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) came to be distanced by the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and he supported the Jimyoin line and deepened the confrontation between the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) .
After that , when Kinmune SAIONJI died , the Kamakura bakufu was ruined and he was dismissed from the position of Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO , who was the remnants of the Hojo clan , and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration and planned to install the Retired Emperor Go - Fushimi in the Jimyoin Imperial line , and Kinmune was arrested due to the betrayal of his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI who was a younger brother of Kinshige SAIONJI who was in charge of the betrayal of the Jimyoin line .
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Sanetoshi SAIONJI , a son of Kinmune and served the Northern Court ( Japan ) and became Udaijin ( minister of the right ) and restored the family name .
During the Muromachi and Edo periods , he was also known as a family who was the family business of biwa ( Japanese lute ) .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime ( later disinherited from the inheritance ) , the eldest daughter of Tadataka HOSOKAWA who was the heir of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later became disinherited ) and was appointed to Sadaijin ( Minister of the Left ) but Kyumu NAGAOKA donated 600 koku ( crop yield ) to the Saionji family and donated 600 koku ( crop yields ) .
He was adopted by the Tokudaiji family of the same Kanin school , Kinmochi SAIONJI and served as a politician after the Meiji Restoration , and he was active as a statesman and became active in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods .
Although Kinmochi , who was the family business of the Saionji family , was a hard - liner , he was said to be a bad play by the Emperor Meiji in half of his bad talent , and he was said to have been a member of the Saionji family who was a member of the Gagaku ( Bureau of Popular Affairs ) and biwa biwa ( Japanese lute ) in the Imperial Household Ministry and had a play with the members of the Gagakuryo ( Bureau of the Palace Table ) and the biwa biwa ( Japanese lute ) .

It is commonly accepted that the name of ' Pillow Book ' comes from this .
According to the " Study of Pillow Book " by Kazuko HAYASHI , he has been a researcher of his own theory and the past Keichu ORIGUCHI , Nobuo ORIGUCHI and Kikan IKEDA .

The writer of the novel : Utamakura , Shintoku , and terms are often used in many chapters .
Bazenroku ( Dialogue of the Bibbles ): The term means a herb that should be used as a supplementary record of the pillow .
Second , the theory of the treasury
Mutual theory
However , there is no popular theory .
In addition , the word " Makura no soshi " was used as a common noun , in which beautiful colors were expressed in " Eiga monogatari " ( The Tale of Flowering Fortunes ) were used as a common noun .
According to the postscript written in 996 , the first edition was written in the same period , and the left Sachujo MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa was brought to the house of the author and spread to the world .
There are some books that seem to have been written in the end of the 1000 's , and it is considered that it was written in the late Heian period .
The text of " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) which is written in the old commentary of " The Tale of Genji " is not existing in the text of " The Tale of Genji , " and this is a complicated process of the completion of the Tale of Genji .
The difference between the book and the book is larger .
It consists of three volumes .
There are various books that have been written by FUJIWARA no Sadaie , who was thought to be the Emperor and Gu and had an esoteric book in 1228 by FUJIWARA no Sadaie .
It is considered to be easy to read ' Buni ga ga ga sutetetetetete wo suitametetetetete wo naetetetetetetete wo naotobitametete wo naetetetete wo naototototenenenu naototototenenenenenu naotototototototenenenenu naototototototototototototenenenenenenenenenenu is considered to be the most popular form of the past .
In addition , Kikan IKEDA was differentiated into two types .
The first category ( Kogu ): 70 stories including ' Haru Akebone ' ( spring ) were left and the beginning of the book begins with ' Hanachiyo Yobana ' ( What is here here is a kind of a book ) .
It is 230 stories .
The Yomei Bunko Library owned by the Imperial Household Archives and the Archives of the Imperial Household Archives owned by the Takamatsunomiya family

The former Kuramoto manuscript , the Kariya Library , the former owned by the Date family , the Kajuji family and the Kajuji family , the former owned by the Kajuji family , the former collection of the Koreson Bunkado Bunko
It is said that Noin Hoshi , who was a relative of Sei Shonagon , was related to the introduction of Sei Shonagon , was a descendant of Noin Hoshi who was a biological child of Sei Shonagon .
It dates back to the end of the Kamakura period .

It is only a book handed down from Kaga Province and the Maeda family ( owned by Maeda Ikutoku - kai [ Maeda Ikutoku Association ] ) .
In the boxes of gold makie ( Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold powder ) , a box was placed in a box , and it is described as " Sei Shonagon 's Pillow Book " in the case of gold and silver inlaid with gold and gold inlaid with gold powder .
It is an important cultural property .
It is said to be the oldest transcription of " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) in the early Kamakura period .
Among them , the Sakai - bon manuscript was compiled in " Gunsho ruiju " ( Collection of Japanese historical documents compiled by Imperial command ) , and the third volume of Sakai - bon was included in the " Shinryo Ruiju " ( New Classified Documents of Japanese History ) .
In addition , because Noin bon was used as the original edition of the old printing block in the early Edo period ( Kanei era ) , it became a set of commentaries such as " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) and " Makura no soshi " ( the Pillow Book ) and " Haru no soshi " ( the Pillow of the Pillow of the Pillow of the Pillow of the Pillow of the Pillow of the Pillow Book ) in the early Edo period , it was used as the main textbook until the modern period .
However , in 1946 , the third volume was reevaluated by Jutaro TANAKA ( 1917 - 1987 ) and the second volume was reevaluated , and after World War II , it became a situation where the book was mainly published .
In addition , it seems to have been used in the text of the kotobagaki ( verb book ) , and there are seven sections of the picture scrolls of the Pillow Book , which are thought to have been created in the late Kamakura period , and the seven sections are still extant .
The third volume has more than 300 independent chapters .
In many cases , the ' Monshu ' ( chapter of the Diary ) , such as ' Sujikimono ' ( flowers ) and ' Utsukushiki - mono ' ( things that are used in the Heian period ) are the ones that are represented by ' Ruiju - no - dan ' ( chapter of the Classic of the Ruial ) and ' Zuishin - no - no - dan ' ( chapter of the Athletic of the Athletic Life ) where daily life and natural observation of the seasons are observed , are seen in daily life and the ' Zuishin - no - dan ' ( chapter of the Excerpts of the Explanation of the Life ) which is the author of the Imperial Court of the Imperial Court who attended the court society around the Imperial Court of the Imperial Court in the Imperial Court and the Imperial Court of the Imperial Court of the Imperial Court in the Imperial Court of the Imperial Court and so on .
However , there are differences in classification , such as ' Haru no Akebone ' ( the first section of the chapter ' Haru no Akebone ' is a different from the fact that the first chapter is a different from that of the chapter in the chapter of ' Zuisho - dan ' ( chapter of the first chapter ) .

The sensation of the author was fascinated and the sharp observation of the things was blended and the emotional expression of " The Tale of Genji " was expressed as ' Nohare ' in contrast to ' Nohare ' and the beauty of the world of ' Sagashi . '

In each chapter of each chapter of the fiction of the following episode , the rich materials are not distinguished from those of the expression , and the sky is lacked in the shape of the sky and the sky is horizontal by the expression of self - expression , which is not distinguished from the universe and the universe of each of the contents .
The expression of ' season ' ( spring ) is based on the fact that the word ' season ' ( spring ) is used in " Kokinshu ( Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) , which is seen in Kokinshu ( the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) , followed by a telephone of the ' spring , ' ' flowering flower , ' while the reading of waka was familiar with traditional traditional Japanese traditional Japanese tradition and was used as a challenging of the modification of the beauty of the readers of the readers who were familiar with the sense of beauty of beauty of beauty of the Japanese traditional Japanese traditional Japanese poetry ( Shun , and Hana ) ' .
It appeared in the love of Chugu Teishi , the Empress Teishi .
It was written in order to calm Sadako who died during the midst of misfortunes that the Michitaka family declined .

criticism

Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and he was the fifteenth Seii Taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , from December 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 .
He was the only shogun who did not attend the affairs of the shogun in the Edo - jo Castle .
He was Naidaijin ( minister of the center ) Juichii ( Junior First Rank ) and the First Order of the Rising Sun .
He was a member of the House of Peers ( Japan ) .
After the death of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the 14th shogun , who served as the guardian of the shogun , he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
After Emperor Meiji returned to the government (= Taisei Hokan [ transfer of power back to the emperor ] ) , he aimed at the Kobu Gattai ( integration of the imperial court and the shogunate ) but in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi he left the former bakufu army and returned to the Edo Castle and was ordered by the Imperial Court to hunt down and kill the shogunate , and he was ordered to leave the castle to the Edo Castle and was confined to the Imperial Court .
When he was suspended from house arrest in the Meiji period , he died in his hobbies and lived until the Taisho period as a duke .
Yoshinobu was also called ' Yoshinobu ' or ' Keiki ' as his common name .
There is a record that the official documents of the Edo bakufu were read as " Yoshihisa " in the official documents of the Edo bakufu .
The name of the word ' Yosai ' is also used in the alphabet and the English newspaper ' Yohi Ha ' .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' Yoshinobu ' but in Shizuoka City , where he lived there is often called ' Keiki ' in which he is often called ' Keiki ' in his hometown .
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu before his death , Yoshinobu seemed to be fond of ' Keiki - sama ' and he also used the telephone that he was a younger brother of Akitake TOKUGAWA as his name in the telegraph that he was given to his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA , who was the successor of Yoshinobu , was also called ' Keyu sama ' by the people around him .
The two names of ' Keisan ' and ' Keijiki - san ' can be found in modern times , but the names of ' Keisan ' are not limited to the present day , and in some cases they are often found in various places , they are often used as ' quite a close associate . '
Ryotaro SHIBA said that ' people concerned with the former shogun 's retainers were often called " Keiki " but it can be said that it was a good person in a broad area because it was used by those involved in the Higo Domain who were in the overthrow of the bakufu as well as those who were involved in the overthrow of the Shogunate .
On October 29 , 1837 , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was a legal wife , Princess Yoshiko ( the third shogun , Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) , who became a lawful wife of the third shogun , and became the third shogun .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is said to be Oe no kata , who was the lawful wife of his father , Hidetada in front of the book , but there is a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was Shichiromaro .
In accordance with the educational policy of Nariaki , he moved to the Mito Domain seven months after his birth , and he was taught by Shokusai IZAWA , who had inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , for many of his studies and martial arts from the Tokugawa family .
It seems that Yoshinobu was notorious at that time , and Nariaki also thought that Nariaki was not adopted by other families , and he thought that he was not allowed to remain in his hands as a hika of his eldest son ( legitimate son ) and Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered Shichiromaro from the Mito Domain to inherit the position of Gosankyo Ichikyo Ichikyo Ichikyo family .
After that , Shichiromaro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 and in December he was given the name of Yoshinobu by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence and thought that Yoshinobu was a powerful candidate for the successor of the shogun , but he gave up the position of roju Masahiro ABE , who was a member of shogun 's council of elders .
In 1853 , during the chaos of the arrival of the Black Ships , Shogun Ieyoshi died of illness and the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA did not have a son , and he was in poor health and he was not able to have a son , and the issue of ' Shogun is a successor to the Shogun . '
The Nanki school which supported Yoshinobu and Nariakira SHIMAZU , the lord of the Satsuma Domain , and the lord of the Kishu Domain , Naosuke II and Iesada 's real mother Honjuin , who supported Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA , who were the lord of the Hikone Domain and the lord of the Kishu Domain , opposed the conflict between Nariaki and Masahiro ABE , and Nariakira SHIMAZU , and the Nanki faction which led to the first time of the Tokugawa family .
Although the Hitotsubashi school tried to support Tenshoin as an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , and sent to O - oku ( inner halls where the Shogun and the Shogun resided ) as the Shogun and Midaidokoro ( shogun 's wife of the Shogun and the Shogun of the Edo shogunate ) to the O - oku ( inner halls of the inner halls of the Edo Castle where the Shogun resided ) after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died in 1858 , Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister ) and became Tairo ( chief minister ) .
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and America without Imperial sanction .
Yoshinobu went to Fujiki - jo Castle with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of the Fukui Domain , but he was accused of the crime of Fuitori - jo Castle , and he was confined to retirement in 1859 the following year and Ansei no Taigoku .
In addition , Yoshinobu did not want to become the heir of the shogun , but he sent a letter from Nariaki to Nariaki saying ' It is not a translation . '
In 1860 , he was confined to the house arrest .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy Shigenori OHARA was guarded by the Satsuma army led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , and the Imperial envoy was ordered to enter Edo to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as the guardian of the Shogun and Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA ) as Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On July 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as the guardian and Shungaku as the president of the political affairs .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku did not carry out the reform of the shogunate called Bunkyu Reforms , and established the Kyoto Shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) and relaxed the Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as the pioneer of Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court who was in charge of expulsion of foreigners .
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , Iemochi was unable to decide the expulsion of foreigners , and he was forced to have an audience with Iemochi , who was called ' fetter ' ( temporary illness ) .
When the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of restoring the Emperor and expelling the barbarians ) group led by the Choshu clan was expelled due to the Coup of August 18 and the Incident of the Choshu clan , he went back to Kyoto again to participate in the council of councilors by the Kobu Gattai and the Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the shogunate ) .
However , it can be said that the meeting did not have a meeting , and it can be said that he was drunk in the sake seats of the Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko and defeated Munenari DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , and he also made an end to the situation of the government and he could not be able to break down the situation .
After that , he was appointed to the governor of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto , Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Aizu Domain ) , the lord of the Aizu Domain , and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Kuwana Domain ) , who served as Shugoshiki ( military governor ) and Shugoshiki ( military governor ) of the Imperial Court , and he was in charge of controlling the royalists and court nobles ( Ichikai - bashi Bridge and Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA , who supported Yoshinobu , showed the coolness of his family and vassals of the Mito Domain , who were his parents ' family and the Mito Domain .
In 1864 , he commanded the bakufu army in the Kinmon Incident , and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of Choshu , he worked hard for the Imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce which had been without imperial sanction and succeeded in obtaining imperial sanction while he succeeded in obtaining the Imperial sanction from the United States of America and the United States .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an imperial order to conquer Choshu .
However , the army of the bakufu refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma Domain which had formed the Satsuma - Choshu Alliance , but the bakufu was defeated .
On July 20 , during the second conquest of Choshu , Shogun Iemochi died in Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu took part in the Imperial Court and succeeded in the conclusion of the Agreement of the war .
Although he was recommended as the successor of Iemochi , Yoshinobu firmly declined the position .
On August 20 , the Tokugawa shogunate succeeded to the throne , but the position of Shogun continued to be rejected .
After that , roju and other members were asked to assume the position of shogun , but they were not accepted , and on December 5 , they were appointed as Shogun by the Emperor of the Imperial Court .
This was a way to become a shogun by selling a favor and to promote politics to compete with politics .
Yoshinobu was supported by the French legation , Lion Léon , and Ref , and he established the iron office of 240 million dollars from France , and invited the military advisers such as Julian and Britain to reform the military 's reform .
In addition , he also encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Paris World Exposition and also to study in Europe where he was a shogun 's retainer .
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port , the Imperial Court was forced to accept the Imperial Court .
Yoshinobu , who was predicted by the Satsuma and Choshu , decided to return to the Imperial Court on October 14 , 1867 ( the previous hand was the first to attack the Shogunate ) , and on the next day , the imperial sanction was given to the Imperial Court ( Taisei Hokan [ transfer of power back to the Emperor ) .
It is said that the Imperial Court judged that there was no administrative capability , and tried to find the existence of the Tokugawa government in the form of the council of feudal lords .
However , in December Yoshinobu ordered Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA , a plan to overthrow the Shogunate , and Yoshinobu issued the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule and issued the Decree for the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule and the Great Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued , and Yoshinobu was ordered to ' Jikan no Nochi ' ( resignation of the Minister of the Interior ) ( dedicated to the Tokugawa territory .
Yoshinobu left Osaka - jo Castle to avoid conflict , and he insisted that the Tokugawa clan should be the legitimacy of the foreign minister , and also made the Imperial Court moves the movement to revise the Jikan nochi ( a place where the government officials were in charge of their own own lands and their own lands were given to their own members of the Imperial Court ) to make a gentle form of the bakufu .
However , in 1868 , the Satsuma Domain raised an army in Edo , and he took charge of the soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana Domains , and he was forced to leave Kyoto .
However , in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi which broke out on January 3 , when the former Shogunate army was disadvantageous and even though it was still enough to maintain its military force , he left the army and retreated to Edo in the military epic " Kaiyo Maru " ( The Battle of Toba - Fushimi ) .
Soon after that , the order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu , which was an enemy of the Emperor , went down and the government army led by the Daisotoku ( governor - general of the Imperial Court ) and Arisugawa no miya Taruhito began to go to the east .
Yoshinobu insisted that the resistance faction that Tadamoto ORIKURI had initially been in the beginning of the battle and insisted on allegiance to the shogunate .
In February , Kaishu KATSU was appointed to the position of Kaishu KATSU , and he himself was confined in Daiji - in Temple in Ueno City .
He also handed over the family estate of the Tokugawa family to his adopted son , Yasunosuke TAIMA ( later Iesato TOKUGAWA ) .
When the negotiation between Katsu and Takamori SAIGO , the staff officer of the government army , was not blood , Yoshinobu moved to Mito and continued to stay in the residence of the domain of the domain of the Kodokan school .
In July , the Tokugawa family moved to Sunpu where the Tokugawa family was transferred to Sunpu .

He died on November 22 , 1913 at 410 a.m. in the morning .
On the same day , he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun .
As for the study of military arts and academy , he was born in the highest environmental environment , and he was enthusiastic about swordplay from various martial arts .
Even after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he was one of the most famous swordsmiths of the swordplay who did not hold the training of the back of the swordplay until the time of the return of the emperor to the throne .
When his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA was in a bed of the Tokugawa family , he had his father Nariaki to sleep in the pillow to keep the bedside as a problem of the succession of the Tokugawa family , and he was just just a threat of the barrel , and he was able to sleep with the sword when he was sleeping with the sword when he was sleeping with the sword he was sleeping .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote that when he was in a sleep , he was in the same position as his wife and two mistresses of his wife and two other concubines , and he had a different character from ' Y ' ( Y ) in the case of the assassination .
Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph of his childhood , but it is doubtful that he was not in Japan because he was still a child , because he was still a child .
It is said that he visited Iemochi who fell ill and became ill and he was usually talked about him .
He was known for his bravery , and when he criticized Yoshinobu as ' the Tokugawa family line of the Tokugawa family , ' he was reputed to be a shogun by taking advantage of the expectation of the power of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , he was praised as ' Ieyasu TOKUGAWA . '
Yoshinobu was also aware of the anti - shogunate faction , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan especially said that ' Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI is not an inaccurate tactic of Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI . '
He was cautious about Ieyasu that he would come back again .
Ryoma SAKAMOTO , who was concerned about the decision of Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) and said , ' Daini ( shogun [ shogunate ] ) , and today we think that it is the true mind of the present day .
It is often said that he was given to him and he was often given to him .
He gave the reputation to him and said , ' I will abandon my life , ' and Yoshinobu tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser to the new government in order to give him the position of vice adviser to the Emperor .
However , when Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was a person who was a person of the time , he was in the Meiji period ( after Ryoma 's death ) .
There was no story about Yoshinobu and Ryoma was very familiar with the fact that Ryoma was alive , and the name of Ryoma was very lower than that of the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , and he escaped to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy .
At that time , Ieyasu forgot the horse of gold fans from Ieyasu but he did not forget his favorite mistresses and he was ridiculed by Yoshinobu as he was in love with him .
However , there is a theory that Yoshinobu needed to oppose armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces , and because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the Imperial Court , he was forced to avoid the intervention of foreign countries , even if he was in a long time , even though he was in a long time , he could not avoid interference from other countries .
It is highly evaluated that the new government had to be regarded as an enemy of the Imperial Court , or in the Kanei - ji Temple because it was placed under house arrest , and it is considered that the Emperor and the Imperial Court valued many people ( Mitogaku ( Mitogaku [ Mitogaku [ Mitogaku [ Mitogaku [ Mitogaku thought of the emperor ] and his mother were from the Imperial Family ) ; however , on the other hand , it is said that he did not have been able to deal with the enemy as his lord .
Due to the fact that it was close to the Muikukukei ( revolution ) , the surrender of the Edo Mugbloody and so on , the independence of modern Japan was protected by the modern Japanese independence and contributed to the Meiji Restoration .
Eiichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed to the family head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family and had a close relationship after the Meiji Restoration .
In his later years , Shibusawa tried to compile the biography of Yoshinobu , and persuaded Yoshinobu who was astonished and asked him to listen to his talent , ' Shakamu no kai ' ( Yumeji in the past ) to listen to him .
This is the " Shakamu Yumeki " ( record of Yumeji in the past ) .
In the chapter of a part of the Dankai , it is written in some cases , and it can be said that it is a slight voice of Yoshinobu who was an old age .
It can be said that he was a man who did not like Hisamitsu SHIMAZU and said , " Hisamitsu SHIMAZU was not fond of Hisamitsu , and Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was not a person who was a man of the time , and he was a man of the time .
Based on the historical materials , the book was completed after Yoshinobu died , and it was " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA " ( Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) .
When he was pardoned , Yoshinobu asked Emperor Meiji , who was the highest of the kazoku ( peerage ) , to show gratitude for the Emperor Meiji , who was given the title of the peerage , to the Emperor Meiji , to whom he was given a funeral instead of a Buddhist ritual , and he will be carried out in the Shinshiki .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was not found in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Zojo - ji Temple , which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family , but a circular tumulus similar to that of the Imperial family was built in the Tanaka Cemetery as well .
This is because the Emperor Komei was a good imperial mausoleum , and he was impressed by the Emperor Komei ( " Tokawa Yoshinobu no Konden " [ biography of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ] ) .
When Yoshinobu was pardoned , he said that he would have been a roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) and Katsukiyo ITAKURA , who had been in charge of his life in those days , said , ' Even if Yoshinobu loved his life and he was not able to give him his own life to the former shogun 's retainer . '
In the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , there was a weak image of ' enemy escape ' in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , but in recent years , it has been reviewed by the new modern political system after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and also the broadcasting of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Taiga drama ) .
As with his father , Nariaki , the pork meat of the Satsuma Domain was fond of pork , and it was called ' Buda Ichi - sama ' or ' Ichibashi no sama ' ( means a kind of pork and pork and pork are fond of meat ) .

Except for the following routes , the street is described in the section from Kyoto to Kizu without special notification .
The color of the line is brown ( ? ) , and it is said that the reason why the selection is the ' image of the two ancient capital ' is the reason for the selection .

The Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) except Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West , Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company ) .
Although the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line , the entire section is located in Kyoto Prefecture , and there is no railway line in Nara Prefecture .
Although the Nara Railway was originally constructed by Nara Railway , the line between Kyoto and Nara was split into a part of the Kansai Railway Company ( JR West ) and was separated from the section between Osaka and Nagoya after it was merged into the Kansai Railway Company .
However , the trains run from Kizu Station to the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) , and Nara Station in Nara Prefecture is operated by Nara Station .
JR West was renamed as a nickname for each line of the Urban Network on March 13 , 1988 , but the Nara Line was sent to see the Nara Line .
Because Kintetsu Nara Line is also operated by Kintetsu Corporation , it is sometimes referred to as ' JR Nara Line ' because it is operated by the Kintetsu Nara Line .
In the era of Japan National Railways ( JNR ) , the name ' JNR Nara Line ' was used as a guide and the English character of the board was also written as ' JR . '
The Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Naniwa , Nara and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , which is in rivalry with the JR Nara Line .
While many trains operated in parallel with the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 when JNR was electrified , and only a small local line with two cars of JNR JNR 105 series were operated by the JNR Commuter Train Series 105 for a while after the electrification of JNR .
However , after JR West was established , the JR West was established and after the establishment of the Urban Network Network , the four - car trains were converted into four - car trains ( six cars were six - car trains ) , and the increase of rapid trains such as ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' and so on were rapidly improved by improving the transportation of the trains .
Today , it has a strong nature as a commuting and a line of travel from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Byodo - in Temple in Uji City , where Uji City is located along the line , and Joyo City , which has a strong influence on the tourism of Kyoto Prefecture .
However , it is a very circular shape to the east side of the Momoyama - Shinden section , and the section south of Joyo Station is located in parallel with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line running in parallel with the central part of the town , and the transportation between the Keina and the area is still different .
Although the trains of Nara Train Depot are used for Nara Train Depot , the station is managed by Kyoto Branch except for Kizu Station , except for Kizu Station , except for the stations for the station facilities .
The J - Thru ICOCA , ICOCA , and the Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Tokai Railway Company ( JR Central ) , and the PiTaPa of KANSAI THRU PASTHRU PASS can be used at all stations in all stations .
In the south of Joyo Station , it became a simple ticket gate for the station because there are no stations on the south side of Joyo Station .
After the ' Kuroshio ' train that had been connected with the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line , Sakurai Line , and Wakayama Line , only local trains were operated as local trains until 1991 , but nowadays there are four types of local trains that were operated between Kyoto and Wakayama in 1984 when the limited express train was abolished and only local trains were operated in a special period ( like limited express trains were operated for a limited express train , and special express trains were operated for a limited period of time in a special period of time were operated for a limited express train , rapid train , rapid trains and local trains and local trains were operated in the section between Kyoto and Wakayama Station .
It is the nearest type of the Nara Line , and is mainly operated during the daytime in the daytime mainly during the daytime during the daytime .
Basically , local trains are operated between Uji Station and the local train at Uji Station because of the intervals of 30 minutes .
The nickname of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was decided by the public before the operation started .
As a tourist spot , many tourists use not only Japanese people but also tourists but also other than them .
All the trains are operated by JR West Series 221 and are operated with four - car trains or six cars .
The maximum speed of the track is 110 km / h , and the maximum speed is operated at a maximum speed of 95 km / h , and the other is 95 km / h.
Approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara Station , and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Nara .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamitakoma Station or Tanakura Station on the way to Kyoto , and because they are different from Nara Miyakoji rapid trains , they are slightly different from that of the inbound train , so they are slightly different from the inbound train .
During the New Year 's holidays , the Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari Inari Station .

They are mainly operated mainly in the morning and night .
At first , only weekdays , it was operated on weekdays , but it was operated on Saturday and holidays due to the revision of the timetable revision on March 18 , 2006 .
Although trains stop at each station between Uji Station and Nara Station , there was a rapid train bound for Kizu Station in the vicinity of midnight due to the difference between the local trains running at Uji Station and the local trains running at Uji Station , but nowadays , the local trains running on the local rapid trains ran to the end of the section .

In the Kinki Shinbun Newspaper published on January 6 , 1998 , a limited express train was announced to run on the Nara Line in order to make the Nara Line ( commuter trains with 381 series of series 381 and 381 ) , but the plan was cancelled .
Although there was a time when it was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station as a Miyakoji Rard , the direct train between Kyoto Station and Nara Station was operated between Kyoto Station and the Sakurai Line ( Miyakoji Rapid Service operated between Nara and Nara ) , the direct train to the Sakurai Line is not operated at present .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Fireworks held nearest to Uji Station , but since the timetable schedule is usually limited to the last schedule of the train schedule it is operated only for local trains from 16:00 a.m. to the final train after 16:00 , the trains between Kyoto and Uji are operated only for ten minutes .
Some local trains that arrive at and depart from Kizu Station are located here .
On the first day of the single line , the special timetable for the New Year 's Day was completed , and the rapid trains stopped at each station between Kyoto and Uji Station , and the number of the trains was increased to more than the Uji Station .

By the law , the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama Yodo Interchange are designated as National Highway Route 1 and National Route 478 , and the Kumiyama Interchange ( Keiji Bypass ) , the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange and Oyamazaki Junction , the Taki Expressway ( exclusive for the National Highway Route 478 to National Highway Highway Route No . 478 ) , which are designated by the Minister of National Transportation and National Highway 478 , are designated as the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Road ( Keiji Bypass ) , and the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Road No . 2 and the National Highway Highway Route No . 2 and the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Route No . 2 and the National Highway Highway Highway Route No . 2 ( Keibi Belt Expressway ) .
In the later plan , the Kyoto Daini - gaikyo Road was built in order to improve the delay of Meishin Expressway , the Kyoto Municipal radiation and the construction of the road that functioned as a national highway and the construction of the road connecting the Kyoto Tanba Road and the Keiji Bypass in Kyoto City due to the necessity of the construction of the road construction of Kyoto City and Kyoto City .
The Kyoto Jukan Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway have been designated National Highway 478 and continued to be maintained consistently .
In the indication of the line , it is considered that the Keiji Bypass is easy to use the users and is considered to be the Keiji Bypass in the Seta JC - TT - OST and Oyamazaki JCT .
Also , the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass are different from the ETC system , although there are differences between the fee and the ETC system .
When there is no special note , the Keiji Bypass ( from the Seta Higashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki JT ) as the name of the business route is described below .

( In addition , the section under the management of the Ibaraki Management Office is the section between the Kyoto Higashi Interchange of Meishin Expressway and the Suita JC , the second Keihan Road and the Keiwa Jidoshado Expressway . )
August 29 , 1988 : The Seta Higashi Interchange and JCT - JC - JC - JT - CT / Ogura - Interchange were opened .
March 30 , 2003 : Ogura - Interchange - Kumiyama JC - T - T - TC opened .
As a result , the fare system was unified with other Nippon Road Public Corporation ( Kintetsu Co. , Ltd. ) and the other Nippon Road Public Corporation ( present Network ) .
August 10 , 2003 : The entire line was opened by the completion of the section between Kumiyama JCT , and Oyamazaki JCT .
December 24 , 2003 : The Oyamazaki Interchange was opened .
In fiscal year 2005 , 24 - hour traffic volume ( number ): 24 hours of weekday and 24 hours of the weekday are used as a result of the fiscal year 2005 .

The Uji Tunnel is the longest 4,313 meters in the National Highway Route 1 and the tunnel is prohibited except for 500 meters in front of the Uji - higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange .
In the vicinity of the Kumiyama Junction , the film " Dancing Ocean EV EVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE " was filmed in the film " Dancing Our Warrior . "
When the distance between Seta Interchange and Oyamazaki Interchange is short , the Keiji Bypass is shorter than Meishin Expressway , and when the maximum speed is operated by Keiji Bypass it is operated earlier than Keiji Bypass .
Since there are no resting facilities such as the service area , the Meishin Expressway is often crowded with the buses of the Meishin Expressway , and the rest of the rest of the Meishin Expressway , the Seta Higashi - Oyamazaki Station is the Otsu Service Area , and the Katsuragawa Rest Area are located in two locations ; the Otsu Service Area , and the Katsuragawa Park .
However , the structure of both the Seta and Oyamazaki Junction , which was established after the name of the god , is a very complicated structure ( especially the structure of the JCTTT of Oyamazaki JCT , is quite complicated and more complicated than the section of the road is operated by the Oyama JC .
When you go from Oyamazaki JTT to Suita and Osaka from the Oyamazaki JT , you can sometimes get off with the Meishin Expressway and the left side of the Meishin Expressway .
In addition , since the curve and the slopes have continued , the road is not always a bypass of the Meishin Expressway , because it has a few passages to respect these things , it does not function as a bypass of Meishin Expressway .
This road is a bypass of National Route 1 ( general national road ) , so it is a special road for the expressway and is not a national highway but is not a national highway for a high - speed Expressway .
When you pass from the east side of the Uji - gawa River to the Keiji Bypass in the direction of the Uji - gawa River , you must pass through the Uji Nishi Interchange when you pass the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is an interchange of the Uji - higashi IC ( Uji Higashi Interchange of Uji ) .
For this reason , the general road section between the Uji Higashi Interchange and the Uji Nishi Interchange is often traffic during the time of commution .
This general road section is an unprovisionalized section for the VISS Squadium , so it is difficult to measure the traffic delay .

Higashi Hongan - ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to Jodo Shinshu ( the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) located in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Shinshu sect ( Shinshu Juha ( Shinshu Juha sect ) , which is one of the Shinshu sect organizations , and is the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect which is comparable to the head temple of Nishi Hongan - ji Temple ( formal name of the Hongan - ji school of Jodo Shinshu sect ) .

There is also a meaning that the distinction between the Jodo Shinshu sect and the Higashi Hongan - ji school of Jodo Shinshu ( the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) was differentiated from the Jodo Shinshu sect and that of the Jodo Shinshu sect was legitimate .

Amaterasu Omikami is a god ( human ) appearing in Japanese mythology .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , when the shrine was enshrined as a natural god is enshrined in shrines and other shrines , ' 天下 ' is called ' Ameteru ' ( Amatera ) .
It is one of the deities that deify the sun and are considered to be one of the deities of the Imperial family .
In the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it is written as 天照大神神 ( 天照大神 ) in the Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , it is written as 天下神神 ( 天照大神 ) and also written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
He was also called Ohirume no Muchi no Kami .
In the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there are several gods described in the " Nihonshoki , " but in the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it is unified by the name of the god called ' Tensho Daijin ' in the name of the god .
Although she was a goddess , there is a theory that she was actually a male god .
Since the name of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as " Kotai Jingu Gishiki , " it is said that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) as it was originally the ancestor of the Imperial family , and it is said that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was the ancestor of the Imperial family and became Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
In the Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amatsukasu no Okami or Umeomi no Kami ( gods of heaven ) or when the name of the god is performed before the festival is held , it is also called Amasusashisashimasumeramikami .
In academic documents , the word ' Amaterasu ' and katakana are used as a custom .
There is a theory that it was written in ancient times by the name of Tenta no kami .
Description in mythology
According to the " Kojiki , " when Izanagi came back from the land of Izanami , he was washed away by washing the impurities of the dead , and when he washed his left eyes .
He was born from the right eye and was called Miki no Mikoshi along with Susanoo who was born from the nose .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to rule Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susano who was entrusted to Kaibara was exiled by Izanagi because he said that he would not go to Nenokuni where Izanami had lived .
Susanoo met his older sister Amaterasu Omikami , before he went back to Nenokuni ( the Nine Kingdom ) , but Amateru Daishin was caught in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) and he was armed and waited for the purpose of capturing Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
In order to prove the purity of Susanoo , the three goddesses were born from the real deity of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to the five pillars , and Susanoo declared victory in the victory of the victory .
He was born from the real power of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and was regarded as a child of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and the following five deities are the deities of the following five gods .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Hikutsuhikone
Kusunokuten
Susano who was frightened by this , worked in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amateru no Okami hid herself in Ama no Iwato ( heavenly rock cave ) .
In the world , the sky became dark , and various troubles occurred there .
( The eight hundred million deities of the heavenly god of Chichibu no kami were successfully expelled from Takamanohara by Susanoo who succeeded in making the deities of heaven and earth in the heavenly rock and the Amenokoyagane no mikoto of the sun goddess .
He sent his son Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) , and he sent Amenotsunokami ( the god of heaven and earth ) .
The Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) was subdued and Amenohoshihomimi descended from the Emperor Ninigi during the time of Ninigi was born .
interpretation
In the mythology , Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be the god of the nation because he showed the action of Amatsukami ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) who was born earlier than his son , or in the scene where Amaterasu Omikami was in accordance with the instructions of the god .
There is also a view that the shrine was deified as a deity of ancient shrine maidens .
The other name ' Hibaru ' is ' 日女 ' ( 日女女 ) and means miko who served the sun god .
Although the sun god was originally a male god , there is a theory that the shrine maiden who served was the same god as the sun god was identified with the sun god and became a goddess .
There is also a theory that this goddess was established in the era of Empress Jito , who was a female emperor , and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami at present .
It is pointed out that the birth of the sun and Tsukuyomi is strongly influenced by Taoism in the " Ryoho Gofu Jo " ( Commentary on the Five Fivefold Ages ) of Taoism and the " Ryoho Gofu " ( before the sixth century ) , which is a sutra of Taoism , and the " Ryoho Gofu " ( before the sixth century ) , and the " Kyoho - no - Jo " ( sixth century ) , which is a sutra of the Taoism and the " Ryoho - Gogan - jo " ( sixth century ) , and the " Kyoho - getsu ( beginning of the seventh century ) , and " Kyoho - in - kyo " ( beginning of the 7th century ) , and " Kyoho - in - kyo " ( early 7th centuries are strongly pointed out that the moon of the right eye of the right eye of the right eye of the eyes .
In addition , the theory of the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Saigu , the Saigu , the Saigu , and the Saikan ( vestment ) of the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Shizuki - gozoku ( purification ) ; the names of the five colors such as Shikimura ( purple robes ) and Mitsuginu ( white clothes ) , and Usuki - zushi ( silk fabric ) are consistently divided into the names of Ojingu Shrine and Ojingu Shrine and the Taoism .
Compared to the mythology , the birth mythology of Amaterasu Omikami is pointed out almost equal to that of the ancient mythological mythological mythology which records the ancient period ( 3 to 4 centuries ) .
Since the two eyes are considered to be a sun , it is a universal orange that spread throughout Asia , and there is a theory that it was introduced to Japan along with ethnic groups in the earlier history .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the shrine was transformed into the third stage .
The following are the events and contents of the turning point are summarized .
645 : Taika Reforms
Before that , the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
The sun itself is ' Hijin no kami ' ( the god of the sun goddess ) .
A male god called ' Ameru , ' was widely enshrined there .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines such as ' Akamasu - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima and ' Issunimasu - jinja Shrine ' in Harima , ' Amitamitamitamitamiteru ' in Tanba .
In addition , the term " Otoko - kama " is also used as the name of Amenohoakari , a grandson of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and Amenokari is also the founder of the Owari clan , the Tsunamori clan , and the Kaibe clan .
In addition , the younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi , and the great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : The Jinshin War
Ohihirume no Muchi no Muchimemochi is a ' woman wearing the sun goddess ' or ' Tanatatsume ' ( a woman who is a woman who is in charge of a shelf in the past ) .
In this case , the enshrined deity is interpreted as the Daihihirume no mikoto of the goddess , and there is an interpretation that it is the ' ameteru ' of the snake 's male god as the ' ameteru . '
698 : Kotai - jingu Shrine was established .
The ' Amaterasu ( the Sun Goddess ) ' and the ' Imperial Family ' are the ancestors of the Imperial family .
She was a goddess .
It was created from the nature of the Emperor Jito as a model for the Emperor Jito .
Even after that , the term ' tenteru ' other than Koto - shin was also called ' ama ' ( amant ) .
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( 1060 ) , the part of the word ' 天照御神 ' is read as ' 阿麻神 ' and also in ' 天照神 ' in " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) , it is also written as ' 天照神 ' ( 天照神 ) and also the word ' Amatsuhirume no Menome ' ( 天照女女女女 ) is also written as ' 天照神 ' ( 天照神 ' ( 天照神 ) .
1880 - 1881 , a fierce dispute occurred over the enshrined deities of the Shinto Jimukyoku ( Bureau of Divination ) in Hibiya , Tokyo .
The Shinto Jimukyoku insisted that the three deities were enshrined as the enshrined deities of the Bureau of Divinations ; Amenokakanushi no Kami ( Takamimusubi no kami ) , Takamimusubi no kami ( Takamimusubi no kami ) , and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) should enshrine four deities but the Izumo school should be integrated into the world of ' Yuikai ' ( integration of the world ) .
However , the ' Ise school ' which was the center of the Shinto Jimukyoku was the ' presidence ' that Amaterasu Omikami was the ' presidence ' that ruled the two worlds of Kenyu and the other gods insisted that the other gods were not a subject .
In the end , there were various views such as ' Izumo school was a mere mere mere grudge and the Imperial family said ' It is a blessing that the Izumo school would kill Senke Sonfuku , who had a bad mind in the Imperial family . '
Before long , the controversy was taken over by Emperor Meiji 's decision , and the status of Amaterasu Omikami was positioned as the highest rank .
It is said that the government recognized that the modern state directly controlled the people through the Fukushin Shinto .
Refer to the controversy of the enshrined deities of State Shinto Jimukyoku ( the Bureau of Shinto Shrines ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA introduced Amaterasu Omikami in his own novel and used another name ' Ohihirume no Sumeru ' ( also known as Ohirume no Ki ) .
Since the term ' Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) ' was used as the name of the sun god and the god appeared in the text of the emperor and the word ' Dainichihirume no Ki ' was used in the nature of the nature of the god of nature , it was not necessary to use the word ' 大日日本比売神 . '
In fact , there are many novels written by AKUTAGAWA who were not able to revise the correct , the copying and the scandal of the army and the scandal was not too much to be deleted .
In 1926 , Masaatsu YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who established the Kinkei Gakuin School ( 1926 ) wrote that ' Japan has the belief of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amaterasu Omikami is an ideal to make the world light of Japanese spirit .
The word ' Izana ' in Izanagi and Izanagi 's words means ' what is the world 's predecessor , pioneers and guide people who are going to become a monk . '
Shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami
The shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami are called Kamimeijinja Shrines throughout the country and the main shrine is the inner shrine ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) of the Jingu Shrine ( Ise - jingu Shrine ) .
The Kotai - jingu Shrine is a Shinto shrine that enshrines Yata no kagami ( eight - span mirror ) ( yatagami ) ( yatagami ) as one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family .
In most shrines throughout Japan , the shinsatsu ( shinsatsu for the gods ) of Kotai - jingu Shrine ( Tensho Kotai - jingu Shrine ) are distributed in most shrines throughout Japan .
The term " daimyo " refers to a word that was different from daimyo ( daimyo ) .
It refers to a person who was very famous as a dojin .
It is a small name , which is the case that a pair of a pair of a pair of a pair of a pair of a pair of a pipes is small .
Originally it referred to the people who had power in the region .
In the samurai society , it became a term for bushi who owned many territories or lower parts of their territories .
In the Muromachi period , shugo strengthened their own territories and became shugo daimyo ( shugo , which were Japanese provincial military governors , that became daimyo , which were Japanese feudal lords ) .
In the Sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , a large feudal lord who established a strong territory was called Kokujin ( local samurai ) or Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period ) who were called Kokujin ( daimyo ) or Kokujin ( daimyo ( feudal lord ) .
In the Edo period , the term was mainly used to refer to samurai families given to 10,000 koku ( crop yields ) or more than 10,000 koku ( crop yields ) from the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
Among the samurai who were under the control of 10,000 koku ( crop yields ) under the control of the bakufu were called jikan ( immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods ) .
As the feudal lords and the characteristics of the feudal lords of China were shared with the Chinese lords and the lords were also called lords of feudal lords .
In this article , it is mainly described in detail in detail in the modern daimyo in the Edo period .
Refer to the article of the " Shugo - daimyo " and the " sengoku - daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period ) . "
Daimyo in the Edo period
The daimyo in the Edo period were determined by the social standing of social standing and official ranks , the official rank and the official rank of kokudaka ( crop yield ) , the post of the post and the shikoseki ( consultant ) in the Edo period .
Firstly , it is classified as tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) who were retainers of the Tokugawa shogunate before the Battle of Sekigahara due to the relationship between the Tokugawa shogunate and the Tokugawa shogunate through the relationship between the Tokugawa shogunate and the Tokugawa Shogunate family , mainly served as fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) before the Battle of Sekigahara .
When the Shogun family line was discontinued and the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of Tokugawa family ) were established to keep the bloodline and to support the daimyo throughout the country , and the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) was allowed to use the Tokugawa family as well as the Tokugawa family and were allowed to use the surname of Tokugawa as the Tokugawa family and the Tokugawa family , and the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA and the tenth son Yorinobu TOKUGAWA of the Kishu Domain were appointed to the Mito Domain .
In addition , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to Echizen Domain and the Tokugawa clan all over the country .
In addition , the fudai daimyo who had established the foundation of the Tokugawa shogunate had established the Tokugawa Shogunate family as fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu , and also held important posts mainly in the posts of Tairo ( chief minister ) of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and made the shogunate government to support the bakufu .
Fudai daimyo had a relatively low crop yield and the Hikone Domain of the Ii clan , which was the head of fudai daimyo ( a hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) was given a large amount of koku of 50,000 koku , but the Torii clan and the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , and the Ogasawara clan had a relatively large amount of territories and more than 100,000 koku during the Edo period , the Sakai clan , the Abe clan , the Abe clan , the Horida clan , the Yanagizawa clan , and so on , and so on were only a few fudai daimyo who maintained more than 100,000 koku ( crop yield ) during the Edo period .
This came to be used for separation of power and military power .
After the Battle of Sekigahara , tozama daimyo were daimyo who were subordinate to the Tokugawa family and many families fought against the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara .
However , the bakufu was strongly cautious and actively actively engaged in sports by Inmitsu and he was punished by being punished by being deprived of his status and forfeited his position as a result of fear of his misfortunes and rebellion .
The most famous tozama daimyo were the Kaga Domain of the Maeda clan who were famous as Kaga Hyakudaka ( crop yields of Kaga Province ) , the Sendai Domain and the Kuroda clan , the Mori clan , the Mori clan , the Yonezawa clan , the Saga clan , the Kumamoto Domain , the Kumamoto Domain , the Kumamoto Domain , the Tottori Domain and the Tosa clan , the Tosa clan , the Tosa clan , and the Akita Domain as well as many as the lord of the domain of the Tosa Domain , which were famous for the Tokugawa clan and the Tokugawa clan since the Kamakura period .
Also , the status of daimyo was divided into the status of daimyo who had a territory of more than one koku or more than one koku or more than one koku of rice crops , and those with a castle were called daimyo ( joshukaku ) , and when daimyo visited the Edo Castle were allowed to stay in the Edo Castle were called jinya ( daimyo ) and were not allowed to distinguish them from those who were not allowed to keep their castles .
For more information , refer to the article on the shikoseki ( seat for the vassals of the Tokugawa shogunate ) .
