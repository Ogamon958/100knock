Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a facility for preservative steam locomotives operated by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) in Kanjiki - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
On October 10 , 1972 , Japan National Railways opened a new Ogata ( Ogi - gashira ) in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) and used steam locomotives that had been supported by Japanese railway companies for a period of one century as valuable industrial industry and for the purpose of preservation .
In 1987 , JR West took over the division and privatization of JNR , and the JR West took over the JR West side .
The facility is a current car ( Umekoji Operation Corporation ) and is also conducted as an inspection and repairing the JNR D10 Type 1010 owned by Sagano Scenic Railway and the National Railways owned by Sagano Scenic Railway .
This facility was originally the beginning of the establishment of this facility and it was because it was a repository of steam locomotives that disappeared rapidly from the late 1960s .
At first , the Oyama - ryo Ward in the Oyama - yama station in Tochigi Prefecture was the most candidate for preservation and the site was located in the ' central part of Japan ' but it was officially selected as a preservation institution in 1970 because it was located in the ' site of historic site ' because it was located near the capital area .
In principle , the cars for preservation were examined to be selected as the oldest car ( if it is possible to be the first one can be used , but some cars were not preserved at first , such as C22 - 2 - go C22 .
The facilities are composed of the " Steam Locomotive Exhibition Hall " which utilizes the Ogata type and the bicycle type , and " Historical Materials Exhibition Hall " which was reconstructed and reconstructed by the former Nijo residence of the former Umekoji institution .
The Ogata Kuri was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914 and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the five tentative ceilings of the tentative ceiling , and the Hikomi Line was designated as a national important cultural property along with the Kuchigami Line ( completed in 1915 ) .
In 2004 , the same year , the Doki Gakkai Foundation was selected as the National Foundation for the Protection of Cultural Properties .
In 2006 , the former Nijo Station building ( exhibition ) and the Ogi - shako ( Ogata depot and the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the railway were designated as a national treasure .
The former Nijo station building was built in 1904 by the oldest Japanese style building that was built by the Kyoto Railway Company ( JR West ) as well as the main building of the shrine , and was designed to imitate Heian - jingu Shrine in consideration of the scenery in order to make the scenery of the building .
The Kyoto Railway was nationalized in 1907 , and after that , it was used as a station building for JR West as a station building for the first time but in 1996 , it was rebuilt and reconstructed as a station building in the premises of the Sanin Main Line between Nijo Station and Hanazono Station on the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) , and the interior of the station building is used as a relay site for the old materials .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
The Ogata Kuri is a total of 16 domestic steam locomotives , 16 ( 16 ryo [ unit of volume ] was originally opened from the Taisho period to the Showa period ) and 16 ryo ( 16 ryo [ unit of volume ] was used for domestic production of domestic production and the production of the Japanese steam locomotives ) produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period , and the exhibition is exhibited .
At the beginning of the opening , the operation of the company was basically preserved and there were 15 ryo ( unit of volume ) of C53 and C51 and 2399 cars of C51 and 15 ryo ( unit of car unit ) , but the storage machine has been preserved in the following seven cars in 2006 and the remaining seven cars have been preserved in the form of the storage conditions .
In the fifth car is still a car and two cars ( C57 and C55551 and C5160 are used for the Yamaguchi - sen Line and ' Kitabi - ko ( train ) ' on the Hokuriku Main Line are used for the trains that are used for the trains on the Tokaido Main Line .
Although the motorological machine other than these two cars is not registered and no inspection is conducted in all cases , the trains are not carried out on the main line .
In addition , the ' SL SS ' is operated by the track of the railway in the museum 's house , which is a motive storage machine for exhibiting the exhibition machine .
This exhibition route was once located north of the depot and was used to be a large parking parking area ( once a rest facility and a parking facility in the old residence was located in the vicinity of the old residence and a park ) , but it was changed to the north of the former Nijo Station and the current Umekoji Park Minami Bay .
Even now , it has functions as a institute and is connected to the business line .
Furthermore , after the Takadori factory of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) was closed , steam locomotives were also developed .
Baime
It is derived from ' Ume ' ( plum tree ) which means Umekoji ( Umekoji Styard ) .
All the cars that were designated as the C62 cars in 1976 were designated as a quasi - railway monument , along with the list of the cars of the cars and the conservative tools .

Shomyo is a traditional Japanese music that is used in Japan .
It is a religious music that is used for rituals and ceremonies .
In Japan , it is also called Bonbai or Bonbon - Zoju .
The old style of the Chinese character was written as " myo " in Chinese characters .
It is one of the studies of ancient India , and is one of the five ancient India .
Five Ming , the term " Shomyo " means the five categories of vocational schools , such as the " Karyo ( learning of phonology , the art of the Chinese language ) , the Kyoryo ( study of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the Chinese language ) and the Kyoryo ( technology ) , the medical science ( medicine , the inmyo , the learning of one 's own teaching ) , the inmei ( learning of the ethical teaching ) and the Buddhist teachings .
It was introduced along with introduction of Buddhism to Japan .
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in 754 during the Kaigen hoyo ( ceremony to consecrate the Great Buddha of Todai - ji Temple ) held at Todai - ji Temple , and it is believed that the Shomyo was actively held in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai passed the voice and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo ( mantra of the Shingon sect ) .
There are various sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect , and the sect has its own voice , and still has been handed down to the present day .
The music of the song was not used because it was handed down in the oral tradition of the mouth .
Therefore , the denju was difficult to be handed down in the temple .
Later , hakase , who was a musician of the music , was invented later .
Also , there are differences in the specialized terms such as hakase depending on each school .
However , hakase were a referee for chanting the voice and if they were to learn Shomyo ( Shomyo in Japanese ) , they needed to teach the Kuden ( or Guden ) ( i.e. , Roi ( questions of the leader ) and could not maintain the school and succession of the disciples from the master .
Therefore , the training of the leaders and successor was required to be necessary .
Various conditions were highly accepted and many schools were abolished .
The Tendai Shomyo sect was introduced by Saicho and developed its own style .
After Saicho , Ennin and Anzen became prosperous .
Ryoin , the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu ( Yuzu Nenbutsu in the Yuzu Nenbutsu ) , is known as the restorer of the family .
In 1109 , Ryoin built Raigo - in Temple in Ohara in Kyoto ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) .
The mountain name of Raigo - in Temple in Ohara was named Gyosan , the birthplace of the Chinese Shomyo in China , and was called Uozan .
Before long , two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the dojo of the Uonzan Shomyo of Ohara school .
In addition , Jakurehara later had a group and the Ohara had a voice of two schools .
Later , Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo ( Yomei of the Ohara school ) .
The school was based on a new theory of music and was established based on the new theory .
Since then , the center of Tendai Shomyo was passed down to the current Tendai Shomyo ( Shomyo of Tendai sect ) .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu , Jodoshu sect , Jodo Shinshu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect Shomyo line of Tendai Shomyo are the lineage of the Tendai Shomyo sect .
Shingon - Shomyo is the basis of the transmission of Kukai and is still in the present .
The term " Shomyo " has been systematized since the time of Shinga .
Kancho can be said to be the restorer of the family .
He worked as composer and improvement of Shomyo ( Shomyo [ Ming ] of the Ming Dynasty ) .
There were many schools until the Kamakura period , but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho , by four schools ( Honsoin school , Shingonin , Daigo and Nakagawa Daishin ) .
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period .
The Honsoin school , Shingoin , and Daigo schools were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
Currently , it is divided into Chizan ( Chishaku - in Temple , Kyoto ) and Buzan ( Nagatanji - Temple ) , and Nanzan Shinryu ( Nanzan school ) ( Nara ) , and Nanzan school ( Higashiyama Ward , Kyoto and Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The name of the Nakagawa Daishinryu originated from the Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo ( Shomyo Shomyo of Shingi Shingon sect and Shingi Shingon sect lineage ) of the Shingon sect Chizan school , the Buzan school of the Shingon sect and the Ryoto school of the Shingon sect Buzan school .
Yoriyu adopted the old school of Daigo and adopted the Daigo school .
When Negoro - ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583 , both Chizan and Toyosan were built based on the old school of Daigo and formed a school .
The characteristic is that it is called ' ronron ' ( 論論 ) of Mt. Toyama , ' ron ' ( 論論論 ) and ' shomyo ' ( 明明 ) of Mt. Chizan ( Mt. Chizan .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school ( Kogi Shingon sect Shomyo [ Shomyo [ Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect ] ) was originally the Shinshin school .
The Nakagawa Daishin school was founded by Daishin ( a high - ranking official who studied at the Imperial Court during the Kamakura period ) of Nara and Nakagawa in Nara Prefecture .
In the Eiei era ( 1232 - 1233 ) , the winner of Rengeidani and Sanbo - in Temple moved their base to Mt. Koya .
Later , he called himself Nanzan ( southern mountain ) and was called Nanzan Shinryu ( Southern Mountain ) .
He was also called Shinryu or Nozan Shinryu school .
The songs such as Heikyoku ( Noh song ) , Yokyoku ( Noh song ) , Minyo ( Noh song ) , and Joruri can be said to be a transformation of the voice .
The influence of the hitoe melodies is greatly affected by the music of the single melody .

He was the second prince of Emperor Jomei .
His mother was Princess Hoshi ( later Empress Kogyoku ) .
The empress was Yamatohime no Okimi , a daughter of Furuhito no Oe no Oe no Oenomiko , who was her older paternal half - brother .
He was conspired with NAKATOMI no Kamatari , and killed SOGA no Iruka and Emperor Kotoku to succeed the throne , and he became the crown prince .
And he established the Taika era and implemented various reforms ( during the Taika Reforms , he was the central figure of the Taika Reforms , Isshi no hen [ Isshi Incident ] ) .
He also made a coup d'etat to the Imperial Prince Arima and so on , and he was forced to be executed by inlaid his power in a tray of his power .
Since Baekje was defeated in the Tang and Silla in 660 years , he sent the Prince Kudara , Buyeo Pung and tried to revive Paekche and the Imperial Court .
He stayed in Tsukushi Province in order to command the rescue of Paekche but died in 661 .
After that , the Imperial Throne was still still enthroned for a long time , but in 663 , he was defeated by a crushing defeat in the Battle of Hakusukinoe , and after he moved to Otsu City , he ascended the throne .
After the Battle of Hakusukinoe occurred , Mizuki - jo Castle , a castle and a defense officer were established as part of the policy for defense of national land .

Brief Personal Personal Personal Profile
Empress Suiko ( 626 - born in 626 ) - born
Imperial Prince Sadanaru ( July 12 , 645 - He became Crown Prince
Saimei July 24 , 661 - Shosei ( Shosei system )
January 3 , 668 : Emperor ascended the throne
January 7 , 672 - He died at the age of 46 .
( " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) says that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated in the mountains because he was not involved in the incident because he was killed in the mountain because he was said to have died of illness after the death of a disease , ' If the Emperor was in a palanquin in in the palanquin in in the palanquin and the mountain was not informed of the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in a mountain where he was in a mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was in the mountain where he was not able to be killed by the Emperor Tenmu . )
It is a mystery in the political history of the late seventh century , when Emperor Tenchi did not ascend the throne for a long time , it is one of the political records of the late seventh century .
There are several theories about this theory .
This is the consideration of the power of the Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi and it is wrong to say that Emperor Tenmu was a son of Han who was born before the Empress Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei , and it is based on the theory that he was a different father of Emperor Tenchi .
In fact , according to the calculation of the year of Emperor Tenmu based on the age of Emperor Tenchi and some history books of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , Emperor Tenmu was appointed to the head of the chronology and became the longer .
However , there are many historical materials that contain no contradictory contradictions , and there are many historical materials that have been about 8 to 9 years old in the same historical materials .
On the other hand , there is a theory that the Emperor Tenmu was not a ' father and younger brother ' but he was intentionally opposed to the age of the age when his father Emperor Jomei ascended the throne in the ' Nihonshoki ' ( Chronicles of Japan ) that he had been in the age of 16 when he was still a father of the Emperor Jomei .
Therefore , the year of his birth is 614 , which is the year of the birth of the Emperor Honcho was adopted , and the sixth year of his birth was the sixth year of the sixth year of the reign of the Emperor and the other was adopted by the Imperial family of the Emperor of the Imperial Family .
In the meantime , he was not rare in ancient times , and he also had the title of Tenchi and Michiko who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu and did not ascend the throne .
It is said that the difference between the two were caused by errors .
There are some opinions that the following are not treated as the same as the " Nihonshoki " because the other history books are pointed out as " Nihonshoki " and the history books are different from the period of compilation , and therefore it is not possible to be treated as the same as the same as the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
( See the article of the age of Emperor Tenmu . )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat of Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and it is said that Naka no Oe no Oji was driven from the position .
Recently , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to the basic policy .
If the Prince Naka no Oe was in the end , the Prince Naka no Oe could not kill Iruka and the Prince was able to do so .
In addition , the theory has been advocated because the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki were revised and the theory was changed to the Taika Reforms .
This theory also gives attention to the reason why the Soga clan except the coup d'etat of the Emperor Kogyoku , and the other reasons are not expelled after the coup d'etat and the other questions are not explained as well .
There is a theory that the enthronement was delayed due to the opposition from the relationship between the women of the Emperor Tenji .
This is the fact that Emperor Kotoku described in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) showed the unrest of the relationship between her and Tochi , in the poem that she was a wife of the Emperor and a daughter of the Emperor Tenji , who was the same mother of the Emperor Tenchi .
Although the love and marriage between her half brother and sisters were allowed to be allowed to be forgiven , she was actually in love with the older brother of the same mother , but in the Tenru ( long - nosed goblin ) of the time she was actually involved in the relationship with her uncle , Michiko TONAKA and even after she married her uncle , she was furious about her misfortune .
After the death of Empress Saimei , the Imperial Princess Hashihito succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous Emperor , but there is a theory that the records were lost in some cases .
This is because the theory that the ' Naka no Mikoto ' no Mikoto is a princess of the Imperial family and it can be interpreted that the ' Naka no Mikoto ' is the Emperor who is the heir to the throne until the enthronement of Emperor Tenji .
If the Princess Hashihito = Naka no Himemiko was called ' Nakatsuhito no Mikoto ' ( Nakatsuma no mikoto ) or ' Naka no Mikoto , ' it is considered that she was a special reason for her to call her as a special name , but there is no evidence that it was not certain .
Although it is difficult to prove the nature of political history and historical materials , it is difficult to prove it , and the study of research has been progressed , including cooperation with archaeological results , and so on .
Poems

The Toin family and the Imadegawa family ( the Kikutei family ) were divided into the Saionji family .
Also , there are the Saionji clan , a branch of the Saionji family in Iyo Province , who used the surname of Saionji as the powerful branch of the Saionji clan .
The crest is the left triad and the left three doma is used .
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane .
Since he had a niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , he was caught by the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and after the Jokyu War , he was confined to the Imperial Court and gained the power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi ( liaison between the Kanto and Kanto region ) and the social standing of Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) .
The name of the Saionji family originated from the name of the temple which was built in the villa of Kintsune in Kyoto ( Kitayama - mura , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono and the current Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA from the Saionji family .

Sanekane SAIONJI approached Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) , and he put his daughter to the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
However , after Kinhira SAIONJI , his son , had been forced to move from the bakufu to place the distance from the bakufu , and the Daikakuji line supported the Jimyoin Imperial line and deepened the confrontation between the Daikakuji - to Imperial line .
After that , when Kinmune SAIONJI died , the Kamakura bakufu fell and the Kanto moshitsugi post was dismissed from the post of Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO ( Tokioki ) who was the remnants of the Hojo clan , and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration , and planned to install the Retired Emperor Go - Fushimi in the plot to install the Retired Emperor Go - Fushimi in the Jimyoin line , and Kinmune was arrested due to the betrayal of his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI .

He was also known as a family who was a family business of biwa ( Japanese lute ) in the Muromachi and Edo periods .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime ( later disinherited from the inheritance ) who was the eldest daughter of Tadataka HOSOKAWA ( later became disinherited ) and Sadaijin ( Minister of the Left ) Kumu NAGAOKA presented a donation of 600 koku to the Saionji family and donated 600 koku to the Saionji family ( published by the Watarashi Shoku ) .
He was adopted by the Tokudaiji family of the Kanin school of the same Kanin school , Kinmochi SAIONJI and served as a politician after the Meiji Restoration , and he was active in various positions such as a statesman and was active in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods .
Although Kinmochi 's performance was a hard - line and the fact that Emperor Meiji was in a bad play while he was serving as Prime Minister was said to be a ' lute of the Saionji Family , ' he was said to be a member of the Gakuryo ( Bureau of the Palace Table ) and biwa biwa ( Japanese lute ) in the Imperial Household Ministry and had a play of Shikotai biwa ( four strings ) in half of his bad talent .

Second , the theory of the secret book
Mugyosetsu
However , there is no popular theory .
In addition , ' Sakurakura no soshi " ( Pillow Book ) was used as a common noun , in which beautiful colors were expressed in " Eiga monogatari " ( The Tale of Flowering Fortunes ) , was used as a common noun .
According to the postscript written in 996 , the first edition was written in the same period , and the left Sachujo MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa brought the family from the author to the world , and the family spread the original text .
There are some written books that seem to have been written in the end of the 1000 's , and it is considered that it was written in the late Heian period .
The text of " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) which is written in the old commentaries of The Tale of Genji is not existing in the text of " The Tale of Genji " which is written in the Tale of Genji , and it is a complicated process of the completion of the book .

There are various books that have been written by FUJIWARA no Sadaie who was thought to be the Emperor and Gu and had an Okugaki ( Okugaki in 1228 by the Imperial Court in 1228 by the old lunar calendar ) .
It is considered that the most popular form of the book is easy to read as ' Buni ga ga ga ga ga sutete wo sutete wo natte yatare natten , ' and it is considered to be the most likely way of the past .
In addition , Kikan IKEDA was distinguished into two types .
The first category ( Kogu ): The first seventy stories including ' Haru Akebone ' ( spring ) were left and the beginning of the book starts with ' This is a fool . '
It is 230 stories .

It dates back to the end of the Kamakura period .
The theory is almost almost the same as that of the three volumes , the end of the dispute of Zenpon ( Zenpon [ Zenpon [ Zenbon ] and the Zenbon ) was widely discussed and the origin of Noin bon is the same as that of the manuscript of Noin book .
It is 230 stories except the seventy - six stories of the beginning of the book .
300 stories
It is a form of a kind of san .
It is a denpon ( books of the Edo period ) in the Muromachi period .

It is an important cultural property .
It is said that the oldest manuscript of " Makura no soshi " is the manuscript copied in the early Kamakura period .
Among them , the Sakai - bon manuscript was compiled in " Gunsho ruiju " ( Collection of Japanese historical documents compiled by the Tokugawa Shogunate ) and the third volume of Sakai - bon was included in " Shinko Ruiju " ( New Classified Documents of Japanese History ) .
Also , because Noin bon was used as the original edition of the old printing block in the early Edo period ( Kanei era ) , it was used as a commentary and published in the early Edo period , and the book was mainly based on the basis of the books such as " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) and " Makura no soshi " ( the Pillow Book ) and the " Haru no soshi " ( the Commentary on the Pillow Book ) .
However , in 1946 , the third volume was reevaluated by Jutaro TANAKA ( 1917 - 1987 ) and the second volume was reevaluated and the second major publication was mainly used for the publication after World War II .
In addition , it seems that the book was used in the text of the verb and it is thought that the " Three Books of the Imperial Book " was used in the picture scrolls of the late Kamakura period , and the seven sections are also included in the " Pillow Book " of the Pillow Book .
The second volume has an independent chapter of more than 300 of the third volume and has an independent chapter .
The ' Monshu ' ( chapter of the Diary ) , which is typified by ' Sujikimono ' ( flowering flowers ) and ' Utsukushishiki mono ' ( things that are used in the Heian period ) are ' Ruiju ' ( based on the ' Ruiju ' ( based on the text ) , ' Zuiso - dan ' ( chapter of the Aijuffection of the Athletic Life ) which is observed , and ' Saisho no Sho ' ( chapter of the Diary ) , which is a collection of the Imperial Court that is seen in daily life and seasonal events of the seasons , and so on , are often created in the ' Sai - dan ' ( chapter of the Diaries of the Imperial Court ) that the following the ' Shiki ' ( chapter of the author of the Imperial Court in the Diaries of the Diaries of the Imperial Court that the Imperial Court and so on .
However , there are differences in classification , such as the first chapter of the chapter ( For example , ' Haru Akebone ' is a different version of the chapter in the first section of the chapter of the chapter is a different from the following descriptions ) .
It is written in a simple style of Japanese language that uses hiragana ( kana syllabary ) , and it is written in general that many of them were written in simple and light and simple and simple and simple and simple and simple and simple writing style , but reflecting the decline of the Chancellor , the decline of the family and the empress of the Emperor , and some people felt frightened by the fact that they were frightened by the fact that they were frightening the life of the Emperor Teishi 's lord , and the Emperor was in a sense of displeasure when they were in the past .
The sensance of the author was fascinated and the sharp observation of the things was blended and the emotional expression of " The Tale of Genji " was expressed as ' Nohare ' and the beauty of ' sakashikashi ' was expressed in the sense of ' beauty . '
Virational evaluation
Since the Emperor loved human existence and nature and formed the Jogaku and Sakuryo as a beautiful beauty of various kinds of various kinds of trends ( makura no sakura ) .
In the following section , the color of the renso ( fencing ) is different from the ones of the contents , the rich materials are not distinguished from the Aso ( thought ) , the zuio , and the other parts are also arranged in the respective chapters , and the expression of Tenma is expressed in the vertical and long ( Ogigaya ) .
The expression of ' season ' ( seasonal - dressing ) is a new term of the Shindo ( common people ) that was used in the Kokinshu ( collection of Japanese poetry compiled by the Imperial Court in the late Heian period ) in which the word ' Shun - Hana ' ( spring ) and ' Asa ' ( flower ) appeared in the Kokinshu ( collection of Japanese poetry and the Japanese poetry compiled by the Imperial Court in the late Heian period ) was used as a sign of the traditional Japanese traditional Japanese traditional Japanese traditional style and the sense of readers who were familiar with the sense of beauty of beauty and were familiar with the traditional Japanese traditional Japanese traditional Japanese traditional Japanese traditional Japanese style and the traditional style of the traditional Japanese style of the traditional Japanese style of the Japanese poetry and the word ' Shun - Hana ' ( spring , ' Shuni - hu ( spring , and so on ) .

criticism
Even after he forgot from Sei Shonagon , he was a lively figure who tried to become a member of the same class as the upper upper of the mountain , and he was also a person who was a good person .
( There is no respect to those who are not a relative of their relatives but a high status of the family status ( not a relative . )
It is not written by the qualification of ' individual ' by ' Bunmei no Bunmei ' ( records of civilization ) that Teishi no miya was not written in ' Bunmei no Bunmei ' ( records of the civilization of the Imperial Palace of the Imperial Palace ) ; it is not written by ' individual ' ( 石田二二 ) .
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and he was the fifteenth Seii Taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and he was appointed to the fifteenth Seii Taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) from December 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 .
He was the only shogun who did not attend the affairs of the shogun in the Edo Castle .
He was Naidaijin ( minister of the center ) Juichii ( Junior First Rank ) and was a member of the First Order of the Rising Sun .
He was a member of the House of Peers ( Japan ) .
After Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the 14th Shogun who served as the guardian , died of the death of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the 14th shogun , assumed the position of the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
After Emperor Meiji returned to the government of the Emperor Meiji (= Taisei Hokan [ transfer of power back to the emperor ] ) , he aimed at the Kobu ( integration of the Imperial Court and the shogunate ) but in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi he left the former bakufu army and returned to the Edo Castle and was ordered to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court , and he was ordered to leave the castle and was confined to the Imperial Court and was forced to surrender the castle .
When he was suspended from house arrest in the Meiji period , he died in his hobbies and lived until the Taisho period .
Yoshinobu was also called ' Yoshinobu ' or ' Keiki ' ( pronounced as ' Yusuki ' or ' Yusuki ' ) as his common name .
There is a record that the official documents of the Edo bakufu were read as " Yoshihisa " in the official documents of the Edo bakufu such as the official documents of the Edo bakufu and other documents were written as " Yoshihisa " ( Yoshihisa ) .
The name of the word ' Yosai ' is also written in the AFFBSSSSS , and the English newspaper ' Yohi Haa ' still remains .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' Yoshinobu ' but in Shizuoka City , where he lived there is often called ' Keiki ' in the vicinity of his birthplace in Shizuoka City .
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu before his death , Yoshinobu seemed to be fond of the ' Keiki ' style , and he also used the telephone that he was a younger brother of Akitake TOKUGAWA , as his ' Keiki ' ( means ' handing the world ) .
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA , who was the successor of Yoshinobu , was also called ' Keyu sama ' by people around the same time as Yoshinobu .
The two names of ' Keisan ' and ' Keijiki - san ' are confirmed and the names of ' Keiki ' are often found in various places in which they are not limited to Shizuoka but are often found in the present day , and in either case , they are often used as " very close association . "
Ryotaro SHIBA said that ' people concerned with the former shogun 's retainers were often called " Keiki " but it is possible that the clan was deeply respected in a wide range of times because it was used by the people of Higo Domain who were in the anti - shogunate government because they were able to use the name of the former shogun or were in favor of the bakufu even in the case of the people who were in the Higo Domain .
He was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo on October 29 , 1837 .
His mother was the real mother of the legal wife Yoshiko ( after the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) , and he became the legal wife of the third Shogun and later became the third shogun .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is said to be Oe no kata , the lawful wife of his father , Hidetada in the front of the book , but there is a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was actually the real mother .
His childhood name was Shichiromaro .
He was taught by scholars and martial arts from the scholars of the Imperial Court such as Seisho who were ' allowed to raise the country by the government ' and moved to the Mito Domain seven months after his birth , and he was born in the same place and taught many of his studies and martial arts from the Tokugawa family to the Mito Domain until he succeeded the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family .
It seems that Yoshinobu was notorious at that time , and Nariaki was initially adopted by other families and thought that he was not allowed to leave his own family as a hikae , a hika ( waiting for his eldest son and heir to the Tokugawa family ) of Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered Shichiromaro to Mito Domain to inherit the position of the Hitotsubashi family of the Mikkyo kyo family .
After that , Shichiromaro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 and in December he was given the name of Yoshinobu by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence and thought that Yoshinobu was a powerful candidate for the successor of the shogun , but he gave up the position of roju Masahiro ABE , who was a roju ( senior councilor of the Tokugawa shogunate ) .
In 1853 , when the Shogun Ieyoshi died of disease during the chaotic confusion of the arrival of the Black Ships and the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA did not have a son , he became a problem that he had no son and had a son in poor health and had a problem that he would have a successor to the Shogun ( Shogun ) .
The Nanki school which supported Yoshinobu was opposed to Nariaki and Masahiro ABE , the lord of Satsuma Domain , Nariakira SHIMAZU , and the lord of the Kishu Domain , Naosuke II , the lord of Hikone Domain and the real mother of Iesada and Honjuin School of the Edo bakufu who supported Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA , and the lord of the Kishu Domain , and the Nanki group who had the first time confronted the Nanki group of the Tokugawa family and the Nanoku faction that led to the first time of the lord of the Kishu Domain Tadayoshi TOKUGAWA .
The Hitotsubashi school tried to make Tenshoin ( Emperor 's daughter ) to the O - oku ( inner halls of the Edo shogunate ) as the Shogun and Midaidokoro ( shogun 's wife ) of Nariakira SHIMAZU , but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another , the position of Tairo ( chief minister ) was lost and Naosuke II became the Tairo ( chief minister ) and became the successor of the Tokugawa family decided to decide the decision .
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and America without Imperial sanction and the United States of America as well .
Yoshinobu went to Fujiki - jo Castle with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of the Fukui Domain , but was accused of being a crime of the surrender of the castle , and he was confined to retirement in 1859 the following year , and the next year , 1859 he was sentenced to imprisonment in the following year .
In addition , Yoshinobu was not aware of his becoming the heir of the shogun , but he sent a letter from Nariaki saying ' It is not a translation . '
In 1860 , he was confined to the house arrest .
In 1862 , Imperial envoys and Shigetoku OHARA were guarded by the Satsuma army led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU and the Emperor Komei ordered the Imperial order to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as the guardian , and to appoint Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Keiei ) to the Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On July 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as the guardian , Shungaku as the president of the political affairs , and appointed Shungaku as the president of the political affairs .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku did not reform the shogunate government called Bunkyu Reforms , and established Kyoto Shugoshoku and relaxed the Edo bakufu in order to establish Kyoto Shugoshoku and to relay the reformation of Sankinkotai ( daimyo 's alternate - year residence in Edo ) .
In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as the pioneer of Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , and he worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court who was in charge of expulsion of foreigners in the negotiation with the Imperial Court .
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners and the Emperor had to do the expulsion of foreigners from the Imperial Court , Iemochi was unable to decide the expulsion of foreigners and made an audience with Iemochi called ' feteru . '
When the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of restoring the Emperor and expelling the barbarians ) led by the Choshu clan was expelled due to the Coup of August 18 and the incident of the Choshu clan , he went back to Kyoto again to participate in the council of the councilors by the Kobu Gattai ( integration of the imperial court and the shogunate ) and the Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate ) .
However , it can be said that the meeting was not accepted , and it can be said that he was drunk in the sake seats of the Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko and he was abruptly in the presence of Munenari DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , and he also said that he would not be able to do so because he was in a violent situation in the vicinity of the Shimazu 's residence , and he also made a resolution to break the situation .
After that , he was appointed to the post of the Imperial Palace guard in Kyoto , and he was in charge of the affairs of the Imperial Court together with Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Aizu clan ) , the lord of the Kuwana Domain , and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Kuwana Domain ) , and he was in charge of the court nobles ( Ichikai - bashi Bridge and Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA and other vassals of the Mito Domain who supported Yoshinobu showed a cool - down tremendous attitude to the vassals of the Mito Domain and other retainers of the Mito Domain .
In 1864 , he led the bakufu army in Kinmon Incident , and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of Choshu , he was involved in the Imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce which had been without imperial sanction and succeeded in obtaining imperial sanction while he was in the condition of the Emperor .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu was ordered to suppress the disorder of Satsuma Domain and received an imperial order from the Choshu clan .
However , the army of the bakufu refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma Domain which had formed the Satsuma - Choshu Alliance , but the bakufu was defeated .
On July 20 , during the second conquest of Choshu , Shogun Iemochi died in Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu took part in the Imperial Court and succeeded in the conclusion of the Kairyu Agreement of the war .
Although he was recommended to succeed Iemochi as the successor , Yoshinobu firmly refused it .
On August 20 , the Tokugawa shogunate succeeded the position of the Tokugawa shogunate , but the position of Shogun continued to be rejected .
After that , roju and other members were asked to become Shogun but they did not accept the acceptance of the post , and on December 5 , they became Shogun by the imperial order of the Emperor Kogyo .
This was a target to promote politics by selling the favor of the Shogun .
Yoshinobu was supported by the French minister Lion Rof , and he established the iron office of Yokosuka and the Shubunsho ( Shubunsho [ office of the Imperial Guard ] ) and invited the military advisers such as Julier and Franz to reform the military .
He also encouraged his younger brother Akitomo TOKUGAWA to study in Paris World Exposition and also to study in Europe where he was a shogun 's retainer .
In the issue of opening Hyogo port , the Imperial Court was forced to be able to preach the Imperial Court to the throne .
Yoshinobu who was predicted by the Satsuma and Choshu clans ( Yoshinobu was in a secret imperial decree to overthrow the Shogunate ) , was sent to the Imperial Court on November 14 , 1867 to return the government to the Imperial Court and received an imperial sanction ( Taisei Hokan [ transfer of power back to the emperor ] ) .
It is said that the Imperial Court judged that there was no administrative capability , and tried to find the existence of the Tokugawa government in the form of the council of feudal lords .
However , in December Yoshinobu issued the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule to the Emperor and Tomomi IWAKURA , and in December Yoshinobu ordered ' Jikan nochi ( resigning from the Minister of the Interior ) and the dedication of the Tokugawa territory was issued to Yoshinobu to ' Jikan nochi ( dedicating the territory of the Tokugawa family ) .
Yoshinobu left Osaka - jo Castle to avoid conflict , and he insisted that the Tokugawa clan should be the legitimacy of the foreign ministers and also to change the position of the Imperial Court to the Imperial Court by revising the Kannochi ( place where the government or the government officials were appointed ) to the Imperial Court .
However , in 1868 , the Satsuma Domain raised an army in Edo , and he took the side of the soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana Domains , and he was forced to leave Kyoto .
However , the former Shogunate army was disadvantageous in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi which broke out on January 3 , and although it still remained enough to maintain its military force , he left the army and retreated to Edo in the military epic " Kaiyo Maru " ( Kaiyo Maru ) although he had been in spite of his military force .
Soon after that , the Imperial army led by the Minister of the Imperial Court and Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started the expedition to the east .
Yoshinobu insisted on the resistance faction that Tadamasa OGURI first had been in the beginning of the battle , and insisted on allegiance to the shogunate .
In February , Kaishu KATSU was appointed to the position of the situation and he himself was confined to the Daiji - in Temple in Ueno Kanei - ji Temple .
He also handed over the family estate to his adopted son , Yasunosuke TAIMA ( later Iesato TOKUGAWA ) .
When the negotiation between Katsu and the staff officer of the government and Takamori SAIGO was not blood , Yoshinobu was transferred to Mito and kept in the house of the domain domain of the Hirosawa family in the house of the domain domain of the domain of the domain of the domain of the domain of the domain and the domain of the domain of the domain of the domain of the domain of the domain of the domain of the same time .

It was not only a story that Yoshinobu was in fact a mere story , and the name of Ryoma was very much more than that of the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , and he escaped to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemies .
At that time , Ieyasu forgot the horse of gold fans from Ieyasu but he was very fond of his favorite concubine and he was ridiculed by Yoshinobu as he was not forgotten and he was fond of his weak life .
However , there is a theory that Yoshinobu needed to oppose armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces , and because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the court , he was forced to avoid the intervention of foreign countries by the bakufu in a long time , even if he was in a long time , even if he was in the position of Osaka Castle and was in a long time .
It is considered that the new government was placed under house arrest in Kanei - ji Temple because it was considered to be the Emperor 's enemy or the fact that the Emperor and the Imperial Court were highly respected ( because the Mito school and the mother of the Imperial family were influenced by many different opinions ) , but on the other hand , it was not said that they were not able to deal with the enemy because they were not a ' weak person . '
Due to the fact that the government was transferred to the government in the close close to the Muhoku Revolution , it was highly evaluated that the Meiji Restoration was forced to be the same as the fact that the Meiji Restoration was forced to be able to be the same as the fact that it was close to the Muhen 's revolution .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed to the family head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family and had a close relationship after the Meiji Restoration .
In his later years , Shibusawa tried to compile the biography of Yoshinobu and persuaded Yoshinobu to make a comment of his talent , ' Shakamu no kai ' ( Yumeji in the past ) to listen to his talent .
The " Shakumu Yumeki " is a collection of the books compiled in the past .
In some chapter of the Dankai , it is recorded that the term " megi " can be seen in the form of a group of meetings , and it is also possible that the term " me " can be seen in the fact that the old man is Yoshinobu .
It can be seen that he was a man who was not a bad person at that time , and he was not fond of Hisamitsu SHIMAZU and he was a man who was a person who was a person who was a man of a man who was a person who was a man of the time , and he was a man of the time .
Based on the historical materials , Yoshinobu died and he completed " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA " ( Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) .
When he was pardoned , he asked Emperor Meiji who was the highest rank of the peerage , to show gratitude for the Emperor Meiji , and Yoshinobu will not hold a funeral in the Shinshiki style instead of a Buddhist ritual .
For this reason , the grave of Yoshinobu was not found in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in the Kanei - ji Temple , the family temple of the Tokugawa family , and a circular tumulus was built in the same manner as the Imperial family in the Tanaka Cemetery as the same as that of the Tokugawa family .
This was because Emperor Komei was a good imperial mausoleum , and he was impressed by the Emperor Komei ( " Tokawa Yoshinobu no Konden " ) .
After the pardon , Yoshinobu felt fascinated by the former shogun 's retainer who had offered his life to his life , and Seika ITAKURA said that ' He was a roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) and regretted for his actions with Yoshinobu .
Although there were a weak image of ' enemy escape ' in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , it has been recently reevaluated by the new political system after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) and the broadcasting of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Taiga drama ) .
The pork of the Satsuma Domain was a favorite of the Satsuma domain like his father , Nariaki , and he was called ' buta ichi ' ( pork and pork were fond of meat , and it means a single bridge with a favorite of his favorite meat , and a common common character is ' Ichibashi no sama ' means a type of pork and pork is a type of ' Ichibashi no sama ' ( one - sided bridge ) in the same way as his father .
In his later years , he was interested in Western literary works , and he liked pan , fishing , fishing and spinning and other hobbies such as cold , bicycle carp , spinning and carp and handicraft by the shogun , but he seemed to have been involved in French language from the time of Shogun when he was a shogun who was in charge of studying in the French language from the Western countries .
Although it is famous for camera many , it seems that the technique of camera filming was not progressed .
He often wrote photographic magazines but it is said that he did not have been adopted in the magazine .
The great - grandson of the Emperor Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA was a camera many , and his photograph that Yoshinobu was housed in the house of Yoshinobu was discovered and published by the book was found in the book by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA .
He was a friend of his hobby and living , and his real brother was Akitake TOKUGAWA .
On December 3 , 1854 , he married Mikako ICHIJO ( changed his name to Mikako MIGA ) .
She had a daughter ( Keikoin no ike - ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike ike Pond and a daughter of the present day

The name of the railway line is used as the Nara Line of the Nara Line , but the entire section is located in Kyoto Prefecture , and there is no railway line in Nara Prefecture .
Although the Nara Railway was originally constructed by Nara Railway , the line between Kyoto and Nara was separated from the Kansai Railway Company after it was merged into the Kansai Railway Company ( JR West ) and was separated from the southern part of Kizu and the Nagoya Route .
However , trains run from Kizu Station to the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) , and Nara Station in Nara Prefecture is operated by Nara Station .
JR West was renamed as a nickname for the line name of the Urban Network on March 13 , 1988 , but the Nara Line was sent to the Nara Line as well .
Because Kintetsu Nara Line is also operated by Kintetsu Corporation , it is sometimes referred to as ' JR Nara Line ' because it is operated by Kintetsu Corporation .
In the era of Japan National Railways , the name of the Japanese National Railways was referred to as ' Japan National Railways ' and the English letter of the board was also used as a guide board for the name of ' JR . '
Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Naniwa , Nara and Nara in the Kintetsu Nara Line , and the JR Nara Line is the Kintetsu Kyoto Line which is in rivalry with the Nara Line .
While many trains operated in parallel with the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , the Nara Line had been electrified before the JNR electrification until 1984 , and only a small local line with two cars of JNR JNR 105 series cars were operated by JNR JNR and JNR JNR Series 105 were operated by a small line of the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 105 for a while the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 .
However , after JR West was established , the JR West was established , the four - car train was converted into a four - car train ( six cars were six - car trains ) , and the increase of rapid trains such as ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was rapidly improved by increasing the number of trains that were operated in the section of the train that were operated in the section of the JR West .
Today , the city has a strong nature as a commuting and a route of the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Byodo - in Temple in Uji City , where Uji City is located along the line , and the city has a strong nature of the Kyoto Prefectural Road as a commuting and a route of the city of Kyoto Prefecture .
However , the street is a very circular part on the east side of the Momoyama - Shinden section , and the section south of Joyo is located in parallel with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line running in parallel with the central part of the town , and the transportation between the Kyo and the area is still different .
Although the Nara Train Depot is used by Nara Train Depot , the station is operated by Kyoto Branch except Kizu Station , except for the stations for the stations and the other stations are managed by the Kyoto Branch of the Kyoto Branch Co. , Ltd.
In all stations the J - Thru cards and ICOCA , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , Suica of the East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of the Tokai Railway Company ( JR Central ) , and PiTaPa of KANSAI THRU PASSTHRU PASSS can be used at all stations .
In the south of Joyo Station , the ticket gate is a simple ticket gate that is located in order to be mixed with the other stations .
After the ' Kuroshio ' train that had been connected with the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line , Sakurai Line , and Wakayama Line , only local trains were operated in the local trains until 1991 ( sometimes limited express trains were operated in a special limited express ) ( however , in some cases the limited express train was operated as limited to limited express trains for a certain period of time , the limited express train was operated in a special period of time , but the local train was operated in the section of the limited express train and the local train was operated in the section of the section between Kyoto and Wakayama in 1984 .
The nearest type of the Nara Line is the type of the Nara Line , and the daytime is mainly operated during the daytime mainly during the daytime as the daytime when the Nara Line is operated as the most rapid train of the Nara Line .
Basically , the local trains are operated between the local trains and the local trains at Uji Station because of the intervals of 30 minutes .
The nickname of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was decided by public applications before the operation started .
Many of the trains that connect Kyoto and Nara are sightseeing spots that are not only Japanese but also Japanese tourists are used for tourists .
All the trains are operated by JR West Series 221 and are operated with four - car trains or six cars .
The maximum speed is 110 km / h in the double - track section , and the maximum speed is operated at a maximum speed of 95 km / h , and the speed is 95 km / h other than that of the other sections .
The required time of the standard time is approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara Station , and approximately 47 minutes from Nara Station to Nara .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamitakoma Station or Tanakura Station on the way , and the trains stop at two minutes and are slightly different from the Nara Miyanomiya , so the trains are operated in a little distance between the inbound and the outbound train .
During the New Year 's holidays , the Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari Inari Station .

The stops of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service were stopped at this station until March 2001 , and the trains were used in Kyoto and Uji and Joyo ( initially station ) and Kizu ( initially station ) and Nara and JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 were used for the cars of JNR JNR 117 but after that , the Nara Line has not been used in the Nara Line .
In the morning and evening the trains run directly with the Yamatoji Line in order to be used for the operation .
It is mainly operated in the morning and evening in the morning and night .
At first , only weekdays , it was operated on weekdays , but it was operated on Saturday and holidays due to the revision of the timetable revision on March 18 , 2006 .
Although the trains stop at each station between Uji and Nara Station , there was a rapid train for Kizu that ran by local trains at Uji Station in the midnight of the night , but now the local train running in the section was changed to the train that ran through the train that ran through the section before the rapid train ran at the same time .
There are some trains that use JNR 103 series JNR 103 from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays , and all trains are operated in the 221 series 21 .
During the morning rush hours , trains that run directly from the Yamatoji Line are operated in the morning rush hours .
As the rapid train of the Nara Line was intended to prevent the rapid train from being used as a line line for the Yamatoji Line , the color of orange , which was the same as the rapid train in the rapid train of the Yamatoji Line , was used as a line color , but the local rapid type of the section was used as a green letter due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 2008 .

There are trains that directly connect the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late at midnight due to the convenience of operations .
In the past , there were some direct trains that were operated by the Sakurai Line , but the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines after the timetable revision of September 4 , 1994 .
Although the special train is a special train , limited express trains are sometimes operated on the Nara Line .
The train was operated by the ' Kuroshio ' train from 1987 to 1988 , with the nickname of ' Kuroshio ' and ' Kuroshio ' ( trains that were operated between Kyoto and Osaka ) using JNR 381 series of electric train - cars using the Kansai Main Line and Hakuhama Station using JNR 381 series of electric train - cars and the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line and the Hanwa Line of the Kansai Main Line were operated via the Kyoto Line and the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line of the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line .
In the Kinki Shinbun Newspaper published on January 6 , 1998 , the Nara Line announced the announcement of the limited express train operation in the Nara Line ( commuter trains with 381 series of series 381 and 381 series of diesel cars ) but the plan was stopped after that .
Although the operation of the line between Kyoto and Sakurai was operated as Miyako Rabe , the direct trains between Kyoto and Nara were operated between Kyoto and Sakurai ( rapid service between Kyoto and Nara ) , but now the trains that run on the Sakurai Line are not operated by the Sakurai Line .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Festival is held to be the nearest station to Uji Station , but since the timetable schedule is usually limited to the last schedule of the train schedule it is operated only for local trains from 16:00 to the final time and only ten minutes between Kyoto and Uji are operated between Kyoto and Uji every 10 minutes .
Some local trains that arrive at and depart from Kizu Station are located here .
The new day of the time was completely different from the new timetable of the new government at that time , and Rapid trains stopped at each station between Kyoto and Uji and were operated by the number of trains until Uji was increased .
In some years , the trains that were operated back to Momoyama Station were set up as a shuttle train in some years .
In 1992 , direct trains to the Sakurai Line were extended to a rapid train that extended the regular rapid service for the Sakurai Line and a single hour to Tenri Station .

Especially when Tenri Daikyo Festival held every October 26 , the trains called ' Tenri Express Line ' are operated by Kyoto Station from Kyoto Station to Kizu Station on the Nara Line and Nara Line via the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line .

Before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction , the film " Ondo no Taiseido One " was filmed in the vicinity of the Kumiyama Junction .
When the distance between Seta Interchange and Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT , the Keiji Bypass is short , and when the maximum speed is operated is operated by Keiji Bypass is short , the Keiji Bypass is more shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and when the Keiji Bypass runs earlier than the Keiji Bypass is operated by the Keiji Bypass in the direction of the station .
Also , because the rest of the rest of the bus stops are not used , the Meishin Expressway is often crowded with the congestion of the Meishin Expressway , and the rest of the Meishin Expressway , the Seta Higashi - Oyamazaki Station is located in the Otsu Service area , the Oyama Rest Area and the Katsuragawa Park .
However , the structure of the two Oyamazaki and Oyamazaki were established after the name of the god , and the structure of the JCT , which was a complicated structure ( especially the structure of the Oyamazaki JCT , was quite complicated and the road was reduced to a speed of a highway in the area where the road was operated by the OYAMAZAKI JCTC was operated by a new road and the road was operated by a new road in the area of a parallel .
When the section from Oyamazaki JTT to Suita and Osaka is going to be on the road from the Oyamazaki JT , there is a lack of traffic in the case of the Meishin Expressway and the left side of the Meishin Expressway in the direction of Osaka .
Also , because the curves and slopes are operated continuously , the road is not always used as a bypass of Meishin Expressway , because many of the fact that the street is far from the street .
This road is a bypass of National Route 1 ( general national road ) , and is not a highway for the Expressway , but is not a highway for the Expressway .
When the Keiji Bypass is located from the east side of the Uji - gawa River , it is necessary to go through the Uji Nishi Interchange when it is located in the direction of the Suita and Osaka areas .
The Uji Higashi Interchange is the Habf IC of the Uji Higashi Interchange as the result of the change of the Uji Higashi Interchange as the Uji - higashi IC ( Uji Higashi Interchange of the Uji clan ) .
Therefore , the general road between the Uji Higashi Interchange and the Uji Nishi Interchange is often traffic during the time of commution .
This general road section is an unprovisionalized section for the VISSSSSSS , so it is difficult to measure the traffic delay .

Amaterasu Omikami is a god ( human ) appearing in Japanese mythology .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , when the shrine was enshrined as a natural god is enshrined in shrines and other shrines , ' tenteru ' is called ' ameteru ' ( Amatera ) .
It is a god that deifies the sun and is regarded as one of the deities of the Imperial Family ( ancestor honored as the god ) .
In the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it is written as 天照大神神 in the Kojiki ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , and in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , it is written as 天下神神 , and it is written as 天下神 .
His other name was Ohirume no Muchi no kami ( 大日日日比売神 ) .
In the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , several gods were described in the " Nihonshoki , " but in the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , the name of the god was unified in the name of the god called ' Tensho Daijin ' in the name of the god .
Although she was a goddess , there are some theories that she was actually a male god .
Since the name of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as " Kotai Jingu Gishiki , " it is said that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Imperial family and was originally the ancestor of Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) as it is argued that Takamimusubi was the ancestor of the Imperial family and became the ancestor of the Imperial family .
In the Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amatsukasu no Okami or Sumememememami no kami ( gods of the Imperial family ) or when the god is enshrined before the festival , it is also called Amasusashisashimasumeramikami , or Amenosakasumeokami ( heavenly god who is in charge of the gods ) .
In academic documents , the word ' Amaterasu ( Amaterasu and the Sun Goddess ) ' and katakana ( fragmentary kana syllabary ) are used today .
There is a theory that it was written in ancient times , as the deity of Tentai .
Description in mythology
In the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , when Izanagi was living in Izanami , he came back from the land of Izanami , and when he washed the impurities of the dead and washed his left eyes .
He was born from the right eye and was called Miki no Mikoshi along with Susanoo who was born from the nose .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to rule Takamanohara ( the plain of high heaven ) .
Susanoo who was entrusted to Kaibara was exiled by Izanagi because he had kept crying that he would go to Nenokuni where Izanami had lived .
Susanoo met his older sister , Amaterasu Omikami , before he went to Nenokuni ( the Nine Kingdom ) , and he was in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) and he was armed and waited for his younger brother who was in the way to seize Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
In order to prove the purity of Susanoo and the three goddesses were born from the real real deity of the heavenly god of the heavenly god and the god of the three pillars , Susano was born from the real real god of the five pillars , Susanoo declared victory in the battle .
He was born from the real nature of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and was considered to be a child of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and the following five deities are enshrined as the gods .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Hikutsuhikone
Kusunokuten
Susanoo was very fond of this and committed a violent violent battle in Takamanohara and the god of Amateru Otogami , who was in the form of the protocol hid in the Ama no Iwato ( heavenly rock cave ) .
In the world , the sky became a dark , and various misfortunes occurred .
( Yagoro - otenokami no mikoto and Amenokoyagane no mikoto who were the god of Chichibu no kami ( the god of Chichibu 's world ) succeeded in making the gods of eight hundred thousand koku from Iwato ( heavenly rock cave ) and other other gods in order to bring Amaterasu Omikami from Iwato ( heavenly rock cave ) and Susano was expelled from Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
He sent his son Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) and sent Amenotsunokami ( the god of heaven ) .
The Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) was subdued and Amenokimi descended from the earth but Ninigi was born during this time and Ninigi descended from his grandson Ninigi to descend to the grandson Ninigi .
interpretation
In the mythology , Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be the god of the nation because he showed the action of Amatsukami ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) who was born earlier than his son , and there are some scenes in which Amaterasu Omikami was in accordance with the instructions of the god .
There is also a view that it was a god of miko ( shrine maiden ) in ancient times .
The other name ' Hi ' is ' Hi ' ( 日女 ) and refers to miko ( miko who serve the sun goddess ) who served the sun god in the ' Hi ' ( 日女女 ) and is a title of miko ( 神神神 .
Although the sun god is originally a male god , some people say that the shrine maiden who served the god was identified with the sun god and became a goddess .
There is a theory that this goddess was the time when the Emperor Jito was the first emperor , and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami at present .
The birth of ' me ' from the sun and Tsukuyomi is pointed out in the " Ryoho Gofu Jo " ( Commentary on the Five Fiverse of the Five Paper Ages ) of Taoism and the " Ryoho Gofu " ( before the sixth century ) , which is a sutra of Taoism , and the " Nenpo Gofu " ( before the sixth century ) , and ' Nenyo Ingen ( beginning of the seventh century ) , which is a strong influence of Taoism that is , ' On the left eye of the moon and the right eye of the moon is the moon and the moon is the moon is the same as the day of the right eye of the left of the moon and the moon is thought to be strongly influenced by the Taoism .
In addition , the theory of the Ise - jingu Shrine that enshrines Amaterasu Omikami is that the names of the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Saigu , the Saigu , the Saikan ( Saigu , the Ise - jingu Shrine ) , the Shizuki - gozoku ( purple robes ) , and the other are the same as the Goki - gami ( outer robe ) , and the names of the five colors of the Shino - jingu Shrine , the term of the Shino - jingu Shrine and the Ou - jingu Shrine are consistent .
Compared to the mythology , the mythology of Amaterasu Omikami is almost equal to the old mythological mythology that records the oldest period of the time ( 3 to fourth century ) , which is recorded in the old period .
Also , there is a theory that the two eyes were considered to be a day of the solar calendar , because it was a universal root , which spread to Asia and it was introduced to Japan along with the ethnic groups in the earlier history .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the shrine was transformed into three stages in the third stage .
The following are the events and contents of the movable machine .
645 : Taika Reforms
Before that , the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
The sun itself is ' Hijin ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 , ' 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 , ' 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 , ' 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) (
The male god called ' Ameru , ' was widely enshrined in the shrine .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines that are read as ' Amteruiteru , ' the name of the ' Amasune - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima and ' Amiteruitamitamiteru , ' in Harima Province , ' Amitamitamitamitamitamitamitama - jinja Shrine ' in Tanba , ' Amamitamitamitamitamiteru ' in Tanba .
Incidentally , the term " Otoko - kama " is a different name for Amenohokari ( heavenly spatula ) who was a grandchild of Amaterasu and Amenokari is also the founder of the Owari clan , the Tsumobe clan , and the Kaibe clan .

Amaterasu and the Imperial family are the ancestors of the Imperial family .
She was a goddess .
It was created from the nature of the god of natural history , and was modeled after the Emperor Jito .
After that , ' tenteru ' other than the Koto - shin was called ' ama ' ( Amateru ) .
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( 1060 ) , the part of the word ' 天照神 ' is read as ' 阿麻神 ' and also ' 天照神 ' is also read as ' 阿麻 ' in the ' 天下神 ' ( 天照神 ) of " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
1880 - 1881 , a fierce dispute occurred over the enshrined deities of Shinto Jimukyoku ( Bureau of Shinto Affairs ) in Hibiya in Tokyo , and the Shinto religion dispute occurred over the enshrined deity of the Shinto shrine .
The Shinto Jimukyoku insisted that the three deities were enshrined as the enshrined deities of the Bureau of Divinations ; the Kami of the Bureau of Divinations ; the Kami of the Imperial Household ( Amenokanushi no Kami and Takamimusubi no kami ) , Takamimusubi no kami and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) were enshrined in the four deities of the Izumo school , but the Izumo school should be united with the world of the world , and the Izumo school should be united with the ' Yuichi no ichinyo ' ( the world ) .
However , the ' Ise school ' which was the center of the Shinto Jimukyoku was the ' presidence ' that Amaterasu Omikami was the ' presidence ' that ruled both the world of the two worlds and the other gods insisted that the other gods were not subject to subject , and they were opposed to each other .
After that , there were various views such as ' Izumo school was a mere mere grudge and the Imperial family said ' It is a mere threat of the past generations of the gods ' and ' that the Imperial family killed Senke Sonfuku who had a bad mind in the Imperial family . '
Before long , the controversy was taken over by Emperor Meiji ( Izumo school ) and the Kami of Amaterasu Omikami was ranked the highest position in the position of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
It is said that the government recognized the fact that the modern state directly controlled the people by the Fukushin Shinto theory as the creative of the creative system of the Shinto religion , and that it was impossible to control the people by the modern state to control the people .
See the controversy of the enshrined deities of State Shinto Jimukyoku ( Secretariat of State Shinto ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA introduced Amaterasu Omikami in his own novel and used another name ' Ohihirume no Sumeru ' ( 大日日日日比売命 ) in his another name .
This is because the term ' Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was used as the name of the emperor because the word ' Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) ' was written in the Japanese word of the sun god and the nature of the sun god was not used as ' Dainichihi no hirume no Ki ' ( gods of the sun goddess ) because the word was used in the Japanese word ' Amatsuhirume no Kami ' ( gods of the sun goddess ) .
In fact , many novels written by AKUGAWA were not correct , and they were not able to be correct , and were not able to be correct , and the original book was written by the army was written by the referenced by the command .
In 1926 , Masaatsu YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) established the Konkei Gakuin School ( 1926 ) wrote ' Japan has a belief that Amaterasu Omikami was worshipped in Japan .
Amaterasu Omikami is an ideal to make the world light of Japanese spirit .
In the words , ' Inaza ' of Izanami , Izanagi and Izanami , the word ' inde ' means a pioneer of the world , and if it is a word it is a ideal for the people of the world , it is a pioneer and a guide who will become a monk . '
Shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami
The shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami are called Kamimeijinja Shrines throughout the country and the main shrine is the inner shrine ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) of the Jingu Shrine ( Ise - jingu Shrine ) .

Firstly , it is classified as tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) who were retainers of the Tokugawa shogunate before the Battle of Sekigahara due to the relationship between the Tokugawa shogunate and the Tokugawa shogunate through the relationship between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Tokugawa Shogunate family as a vassal of the Tokugawa family ( pro - domain and pro - Tokugawa clans ) .
When the shogun family was discontinued and the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of Tokugawa family ) were established to keep the bloodline and to support the daimyo throughout the country , and to be allowed to use the Tokugawa family as well as to use the Tokugawa family name as the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of Tokugawa family ) , and the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA was appointed to the Owari Domain and the Owari Domain and the 10th son Yorinobu TOKUGAWA of the Kishu Domain and the Mito Domain were given the title of Yorifusa TOKUGAWA as the 11th son .
