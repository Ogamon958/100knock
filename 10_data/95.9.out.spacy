Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a storage facility for steam locomotives that are operated by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) in Kankiji - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
On October 10 , 1972 , Japan National Railway 's 100th anniversary of the establishment of Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) was established in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , and steam locomotives that had been supported by Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) were regarded as valuable cultural properties and the first facility for the purpose of preservation .
In 1987 , JR West took over the division and privatization of JNR .
In addition , this facility is the site of the current vehicle ( Umekoji Line ) , and it is also conducted by the Japan National Railways D1010 which is owned by Sagano Scenic Railways , as well as inspecting and repairing .
In the first place , this facility became the beginning of the establishment of this facility , so it was necessary to preserve steam locomotives rapidly from the latter half of the 1960s .
At first , the Oyama - ku district located in Oyama , Tochigi Prefecture is the nearest candidate to the Tokyo Metropolitan Area , but it was officially selected in 1970 because the site was located in the ' central part of Japan ' because it was located in the precincts of Oyama , Tochigi Prefecture .
In principle , the cars for preservation were examined to be selected , but there were some cars that were not able to be preserved at first , such as C22 cars of C22 .
The facilities are composed of " Steam Locomotive Exhibition Hall , " which utilizes the former Umekoji institution , and the former Nijo building was reconstructed and reconstructed and reconstructed as " Historical Materials Exhibition . "
The Ogata Kuri was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914 and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the five tentative ceiling , the ceiling , the ceiling , which was built in December 10 , 2004 .

The former Nijo station building was built in 1904 with the oldest wooden building in Japan , which was constructed by the Kyoto Railway Company ( JR West ) as well as the main shrine , and was designed to imitate Heian - jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape .
The Kyoto Railway was nationally nationalized in 1907 , and after that , it was used as the station building of JR West as the station building of the Sanin Main Line between Nijo Station and Hanazono Station on the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) , but in 1996 , the construction of the station building was completed in 1996 , and the interior of the station building was reconstructed and used as the main building of the station building in 1997 , and the interior of the station was reconstructed .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
The Ogata Kuri has 16 domestic steam locomotives produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period , and a total of 16 ryo ( 16 ryo [ unit of volume ] , 16 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit of volume ] [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit of volume ] [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit of volume ] is 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit of volume ] [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit of volume ] [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ 1 ryo [ unit
At the beginning of the opening , there were two cars of C53 cars and C51 cars of C51 and 2399 of C51 were registered in the Ministry of Education , but it has been only seven cars that have been preserved for preservation .
On the other hand , the five cars of the five cars have been registered even now , and the two cars ( C571 and C5516 ) are operated by the Yamaguchi Line and the ' Yamaguchi ( train ) ' on the Hokuriku Main Line and ' Kitabiko ( train ) ' on the Hokuriku Main Line .
Although the motivation machine other than these two cars is not available , it can not be carried out on the Tokaido Main Line because there are no inspection in all directions .
In addition , the ' SL Squart ' is operated by the track of the railway in the vicinity of the museum .
This exhibition line was once located north from the depot to the north of the current large - size parking park , but it was changed to the north of the former Nijo Station and the current site was moved to the north of the site where the current Umekoji Park was located in the vicinity of the former Nijo Station and the south end of the current Umekoji Park was running through the Sagano Line .
Even now , it has functions as an institution and is also connected to the business route .

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music .
It is a religious music used for rituals and ceremonies .
In Japan , it is also called Babai or Bonbogu .
In the old style , it was written as myo .
It is one of the studies of ancient India .
Gogyo refers to five kinds of vocational schools , such as Shomyo ( study of phoneticism ) , Kyoryo ( technology ) , Kyoryo ( study of techniques and technics ) , Iho ( medical science ) , Inmei ( ethic ) , Naimei ( learning of one 's own sect ) , and Naimei ( Buddhists ) .
It has been handed down along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan .
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in 754 during the Buddhist memorial service held at the Great Buddha of Todai - ji Temple , and it is believed that Shomyo was popular in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai passed the voice and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo .
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect have their own voices and are still inherited today .
Because the voice was handed down in kuden ( oral tradition ) , there was no gakufu ( musical instrument ) .
As a result , the denju became difficult .
Later , hakase , who was a gakufu ( musical instrument ) , was invented .
There are differences in terms of specialized terms such as hakase depending on each school .
However , Hakase was a reference , and if they tried to learn Shomyo ( Shomyo in Japanese ) , they needed Kuden ( oral tradition ) , and they could not maintain the school from the master to their disciples .
For this reason , the training of the leaders and successors was required .
Many schools became extinct due to various conditions .
The Tendai Shomyo sect was introduced by Saicho and became the basis of its own development .
After Saicho , Ennin and Anzen became prosperous .
Ryonin who was the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu is known as the restorer of the family .
In 1109 , Ryoin built Raigo - in Temple in Ohara in Kyoto ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) .
The honorific mountain prefix of Raigo - in Temple in Ohara was changed to Gyosan , the birthplace of Chinese Shomyo in China , and was called Uozan .
Before long , the two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the dojo for Shomyo of the Ohara school .
In addition , Jakurehara later formed a group , and in Ohara there was a voice of two branches .
Later , Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo .
Tanchi built a new theory based on the theory of music .
Since then , the center of the Tendai Shomyo sect was handed down to the current Tendai Shomyo .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu sect and the Jodoshu sect and Jodo Shinshu ( the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) , Shomyo of the Tendai sect are descended from the Tendai Shomyo sect .
Shingon - Shomyo is based on the introduction of Kukai and continues to this day .
It was after the Shinga period when Shomyo was systematized .
Kancho can be said to be the restorer of the family .
He worked as a composer and improvement of Shomyo .
There were many schools until the Kamakura period , but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho , by four schools ( Honsoin school , Shingonin , Daigo and Nakagawa Daishin ) .
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period .
The Honsoin school and the Shinkoin - ryu and Daigo schools were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
At present , it is divided into Chizan ( Chishaku - in Temple , Kyoto , Chishaku - in Temple ) , Buzan ( Mt. Buzan ) and Nanzan Shinryu ( Nanzan school , Mt. Koya , Kyoto and Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The Ryomei school originated from the Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo of the Shingi Shingon sect ( Shingi Shingon sect Shomyo ) , the Chizan school of the Shingon sect and the Buzan school of the Shingon sect and both of them originated from the Nakagawa Daishin school .
Raiyu adopted the old school of Daigo .
When Negoro - ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583 , both Chizan and Toyosan , formed a new school based on the old school of Daigo .
The characteristic is that it is called ' ronron ' ( 論論論 ) of Mt. Toyama , ' ron ' ( 論論論 ) and ' shomyo ' ( 明明 ) of Mt. Chizan .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school of the Nanzan Shingon - shu sect ( Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect ) was the origin of the Nakagawa school .
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa Temple in Nara Prefecture .
He moved his base to Mt. Koya from 1232 to 1233 .
Later , it was named Nanzan by the name of Mt. Koya , and it was called Nanzan Shinryu .
It is also called Shinryu or Noyama Shinryu .
It can be said that songs such as Heikyoku ( Noh song ) , Yokyoku ( Noh song ) , Minyo ( folk song ) , and Joruri ( dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment ) were transformed into voices .

( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of the Fuso era ) , there is a theory that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated by the Emperor Tenmu after the death of a disease , saying that ' one is the palanquin of the Emperor in the palanquin and the other is the place of the mountain where there is no time to go back to Mt. Nagatsuyama and the mountain where there is no time to be dead . '
It is one of the mysteries of political history in the middle of the seventh century that Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time in the reign of Emperor Tenchi .
There are several theories about this theory .
This is the consideration of the power that supported the Emperor Tenmu .
It is wrong that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is based on the theory that Emperor Tenmu was born before Emperor Kogyoku got married to Emperor Jomei , and it is based on the theory that he was an older brother of Emperor Tenchi .
It is certain that the year of Emperor Tenmu was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) and a part of the history book of the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) based on the age of Emperor Tenmu , and when Emperor Tenmu was still alive , Emperor Tenmu became the longer .
However , there are no contradictory contradictions between the same historical material , and there are many historical materials that contain the difference between the age of 8 and 99 .
On the other hand , there is an opinion that ' the father is different from his father , but the younger brother is bad and a younger brother , ' but in ' Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) there is a possibility that the age of Tenchi was the age of 16 when his father Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the year of his birth is 614 , which is the year of the birth of the Emperor Honcho was adopted , and it is said that he was born in 614 .
There was a counterargument that " Koji " was not rare in ancient times , and Tenchi and Minto , who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu 's reign , held the Shosei system and did not ascend to the throne .
It is said that there were errors for this purpose .
It is also pointed out that other history books which have been pointed out as ' Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) ' are different from the fact that they were compiled in the same period as those of the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) are not treated as the same .
( Also refer to the article on the age of Emperor Tenmu . )
It is said that the Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat caused by Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Naka no Oe was expelled from the position .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of the policy .
When Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji killed Iruka .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) there is a theory that this theory was based on the fact that it was revised and revised to the Taika Reforms .
In this theory , the reason for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka could not be expelled after the coup d'etat and other doubts can be explained as well .
There is a theory that the enthronement of the Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to opposition from the relationship between the women of the Emperor Tenchi .
It is said that Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , showed the relationship between her and Tenchi in the poem that she was a wife of the Emperor and a daughter of the same mother of the Emperor Tenchi .
Although the love and marriage between her half brother and sisters were allowed to be allowed to be forgiven , she was actually in love with the older brother of the same mother , but there were some interpretations that she had a relationship with her uncle , Michiko SATONAKA , and even after she got married to Karu no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
After the death of Empress Saimei , Hashihito no Himemiko succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous Emperor , but there is a theory that the records were lost due to some circumstances .
In " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) , there is a theory that the Emperor came from the theory that he was a princess , and it can be interpreted that the term ' Chuko no Mikoto ' can be interpreted as the Emperor who succeeded to the throne until the enthronement of Emperor Tenji .
If Hashihito no Himemiko = ' Naka no Mikoto , ' it can be said that she needed to call her special name , but there is a theory that Empress Saimei was not certain .
Although it is difficult to prove the nature of political history and historical materials , it is difficult to prove it , and the study of research has been progressed , including the cooperation of archaeologists and so on .
Poems
He was also a waka poet of Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) that four poems were handed down to Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) .
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu ( the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Tanka - poems in the Heian period , the following poem is included in the beginning of the poem .

The name of the Saionji family comes from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his villa in Kyoto ( Kitayama - mura , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono , and the current Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA by the Saionji family .
After Kintsune , he was supported by the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and wielded power of Sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) throughout the Kamakura period .
Sanekane SAIONJI approached Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) and put his daughter to the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
However , after his son , Kinhira SAIONJI , the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) came to have a distance from the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and he supported the Jimyoin line and deepened the confrontation with Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) .
After that , when Kinmune SAIONJI died , the Kamakura bakufu fell , and he was dismissed from the position of Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO , who was a remnant of the Hojo clan , and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration , and planned to install the Retired Emperor Go - Fushimi , and Kinmune was arrested due to the betrayal of his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI .

He was also known as a family of biwa ( Japanese lute ) in the Muromachi period and the Edo period .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime who was the eldest daughter of Tadataka HOSOKAWA ( later disinherited later ) ) , who was a legitimate son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later became disinherited ) and was appointed to Sadaijin ( Minister of the Left ) , but Kyumu NAGAOKA donated 600 koku ( crop yield ) to the Saionji family and donated 600 koku ( crop yields ) .
In the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted by the Tokudaiji family of the Kanin school , and after the Meiji Restoration , he was active as a politician , and he became a Genro ( elder statesman ) in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods .
It is said that Kinmochi , who was a family business of the Saionji family , was troubled by the Emperor Meiji while he was serving as a prime minister , and he was said to be a bad play in half of his bad gig , and the Saionji family was said to be ' a biwa player of the Saionji family , ' and he played the role of gagaku ( ancient Japanese court dance and music ) and biwa biwa ( Japanese lute ) in the Department of the Imperial Household Ministry .

Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , who reigned from December 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 .
He was the only shogun who did not attend the duties of the shogun in the Edo - jo Castle .
He was the Naidaijin ( the Minister of the Interior ) , Juichii ( Junior First Rank ) and the First Order of the Rising Sun .
He was a member of the House of Peers ( Japan ) .
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , who served as a guardian , he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
After Emperor Meiji returned his political power (= Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) to the Emperor Meiji , he aimed at the Kobu - gattai ( integration of the imperial court and the shogunate ) but after the Restoration of Imperial Rule , he returned from the Osaka - jo Castle to the Edo Castle and was ordered to hunt down and kill the former bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
In the Meiji period , he died of his hobbies and lived as a duke until the Taisho period .
Yoshinobu ' is also read as ' Yoshinobu ' or ' Keiki ' as a common name .
There is a record that ' Yoshihisa ' was read as ' Yoshihisa ' in the official documents of the Edo bakufu such as the official documents of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
His name is also written in the alphabet signatures and the English language newspaper ' Yosa ' .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' Yoshinobu ' but in Shizuoka City , where he lived there is often called ' Keiki . '
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu during his lifetime , Yoshinobu seemed to be fond of ' Keiki - sama , ' and he called himself ' Keiki ' in the telephone of his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA , who was the successor of Yoshinobu , was also called ' Keyu sama ' by people around him .
The two names of ' Kiki - sama ' and ' Keijiki - san ' can be found in modern times , but they are often found not limited to Shizuoka but are often found in various places , and in either case , they are often used as " very close association . "
Ryotaro SHIBA , who was referred to as a former retainer of the shogunate , said ' many people were related to the former retainers of the shogunate , but it can be said that they were deeply respected in the broad area because they were able to be used even in the Higo Domain who had been involved in the overthrow of the Shogunate .
On October 29 , 1837 , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was Princess Yoshiko ( the third shogun , Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) , who became the legal wife of the legal wife of the Shogun after the death of the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is said to be Oe no kata , who was the lawful wife of his father , Hidetada , but there is a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was Shichiromaro .
In accordance with the educational policy of Nariaki , he moved to the Mito Domain seven months after his birth , and after he succeeded the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , many of his studies and martial arts were taught by Shosai ISAWA , etc .
Yoshinobu seemed to have attracted attention from those days , and Nariaki thought that Nariaki was not adopted by other families at first , and he thought that he did not have any adopted son to other families , and he thought that he had to remain in his hands as a hika of his eldest son ( legitimate son ) and Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered Shichiromaro from the Mito Domain to become the successor of the Hitotsubashi family .
After that , Shichiromaro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December he was given the name of Yoshinobu by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence and thought that Yoshinobu was a powerful candidate for the successor of the shogun , but he gave up the proposal of Masahiro ABE , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) .
In 1853 , during the chaos of the arrival of the Black Ships , Shogun Ieyoshi died of illness and the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA did not have a son in poor health and had a problem that ' the heir would be the heir of the shogun . '
A conflict between Nariaki and Masahiro ABE , the lord of Satsuma Domain , Nariakira SHIMAZU , and Naoyoshi SHIMAZU , who recommended Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA , the lord of the Kishu Domain , Naosuke II , the lord of the Hikone Domain and the real mother of Iesada 's mother , Honjuin .
The Hitotsubashi school tried to put Tenshoin , an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , into O - oku ( the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants resided ) as a shogun or Midaidokoro , but after the death of Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU , Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister ) and became Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 .
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan .
Yoshinobu went to Fujiki - jo Castle with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of the Fukui Domain , but on the other hand , he was accused of Naosuke 's crime and was confined to retirement in 1859 ( the Ansei no Taigoku ) .
It is said that Yoshinobu did not want to become the heir of the shogun , but he sent a letter from Nariaki to Nariaki because he failed to fail .
In 1860 , he was put under house arrest .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy Shigenori OHARA was guarded by the Satsuma army led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , and the Emperor Komei issued an imperial order to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as a guardian , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA ) to become Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On July 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu to the position of Shogun and Shungaku to the position of Seiji sosai .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku did not carry out the reform of the shogunate called Bunkyu Reforms , and established the Kyoto Shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) and relied on Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as the pioneer of Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court who was in charge of expulsion of foreigners .
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , Iemochi was unable to decide the expulsion of foreigners from the emperor and ordered Iemochi to have an audience with Iemochi , who was called ' fushin ' ( temporary illness ) .
After the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners ) led by the Choshu clan was expelled due to the Coup of August 18 ( old lunar calendar ) , he went back to Kyoto again to participate in the council of councilors led by the Kobu - gattai ( integration of the imperial court and the shogunate ) and the Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate ) .
However , it can be said that the meeting was not accepted , and it can be said that he was drunk in the sake seats of the Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko and defeated Munenari DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU who were staying there , and also asked NAKAGAWA to discuss the situation that he could not be able to do so as to do so .
After that , he was appointed to the governor of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto , Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Aizu clan ) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Kuwana Domain ) , who served as Shugoshiki ( military governor ) and Shugoshiki ( military governor ) of the Imperial Court , and was in charge of controlling the royalists and court nobles ( Ichikai - bashi Bridge and Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA and other vassals of the Mito Domain , who supported Yoshinobu , showed the coolness of his family and vassals of the Mito Domain .
In 1864 , he led the army of bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) in the Kinmon Incident , and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of Choshu , he worked hard for the Imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce which had been without imperial sanction and succeeded in obtaining the Imperial sanction from the United States of America and the United States .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an imperial order of conquest of Choshu .
However , the army of the bakufu refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma Domain which formed the Satsuma - Choshu Alliance , but was defeated .
On July 20 , during the second conquest of Choshu , Shogun Ieshige died in Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu took part in the Imperial Court and succeeded in the conclusion of the Agreement of the war .
Although he was recommended as the successor of Iemochi , Yoshinobu firmly refused it .
On August 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family succeeded to the throne , but the position of Shogun continued to be rejected .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) asked him to assume the position of shogun , but he did not accept it , and on December 5 , he was appointed as Shogun by the Emperor of the Imperial Court .
This meant that he would become a shogun in the form of selling his favor , and he tried to promote politics to compete with politics .
Yoshinobu was supported by the French minister , Léon LES , and he established the iron office of 240 million dollars from France , and he invited the military advisers such as Julian and Britain to reform the military 's reform .
In addition , he also encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Paris World Exposition , and he also encouraged his younger brother Europe to study in Paris where he sent to the Paris World Exposition Exhibition .
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port , the Imperial Court was permitted .
Yoshinobu predicted the ' secret imperial decree to overthrow the shogunate from the Satsuma and Choshu , ' and on November 14 , 1867 , he returned to the Imperial Court and received an imperial sanction ( Taisei Hokan [ transfer of power back to the emperor ] ) .
It is said that at that time , the Imperial Court judged that there was no administrative capability , and tried to find the existence of the Tokugawa government under the leadership of the council of feudal lords .
However , due to the plot of Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA , the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December and Yoshinobu was ordered to resign from the position of Naidaijin and the dedication of the Tokugawa territory .
Yoshinobu left the Osaka - jo Castle in order to avoid conflicts , and he advocated the legitimacy of the Tokugawa clan by gathering ministers from foreign countries , and he also made a campaign to revise the Imperial Court in order to revise his resignation .
However , the following year , 1868 , the Satsuma clan raised an army in the city of Edo , and the soldiers of Aizu , Kuwana Domain were forced to use the soldiers of the Aizu and Kuwana Domains .
However , in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi which broke out on January 3 , when the former Shogunate army was disadvantageous and he left the army and retreated to Edo in spite of his sufficient military strength in spite of the fact that it was still a military force .
Soon after that , the order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu 's enemy , and the government army led by Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started the expedition to the east .
Yoshinobu insisted on obedience by suppressing the resistance faction led by Tadaosa OGURI .
In February he was appointed to Kaishu KATSU , and he himself was confined in Daiji - in Temple in Ueno Kanei - ji Temple .
He also handed over to his adopted son Yasunosuke TAIMA ( later Iesato TOKUGAWA ) , who later became the head of the Tokugawa family .
After the negotiation between Katsu and Takamori SAIGO , the staff officer of the government and the staff of the government army , the Edo Castle was bloodshed and Yoshinobu moved to Mito , and he continued to stay in the house of the Kokudo ( domain school ) of hanko ( domain school ) .
In July , the Tokugawa family moved to Sunpu where the Tokugawa family was transferred to Sunpu .

When his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA was hiding in the barrel , he was just a threat in order to stop the succession of the Tokugawa family , and when his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA was sleeping in the barrel , it is said that his head was removed from the barrel .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote that when he became adulthood , he was in the same position as two of his wife and two mistresses in the name of ' Y. '
Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph in his childhood , but it is doubtful that he did not have a photograph in Japan during his childhood .
It is said that he visited Iemochi , who fell ill and fell ill and became popular at that time .
He was known as a brilliant man and Tatewaki YASUSHIMA commented that Yoshinobu was a real father Nariaki TOKUGAWA , and he was praised as a shogun until he became the ' reincarnation of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA . '
Yoshinobu was also aware of the overthrow of the Shogunate , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan especially said that ' Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI is not a rude of Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI . '
Ieyasu was cautious about the renewal of Ieyasu .
In response to the resolution of Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , Ryoma SAKAMOTO , ' Daini ( shogun [ Shogunate ] ) , and now we know that the mind of the present day is true .
It is often said that it is necessary to be given to him and it is often given to him .
He made his mind and pledge to evaluate him , and Yoshinobu tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser of the new government to Yoshinobu .
However , it was after the Meiji period when Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was the person who was the person of Ryoma .
There was no story about Yoshinobu and Ryoma 's acquaintance in his lifetime was very lower than that of the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , and went back to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy .
At that time , Ieyasu forgot the horse seals of gold fans from Ieyasu but he did not forget his favorite concubine , and he was ridiculed for Yoshinobu 's weakness .
However , there is a theory that Yoshinobu needed to oppose armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces , and because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the Imperial Court , he was forced to avoid the intervention of foreign countries , even if he was in a long period of time , even though he had to protect Osaka - jo Castle in order to avoid the intervention of foreign countries .
From the fact that the new government was considered to be an enemy of the Imperial Court , it is highly evaluated that the Emperor and the Imperial Court were placed in confinement at Kanei - ji Temple , and on the other hand , the Mito school and his mother are thought to have had a strong influence on the emperor and the Imperial Court , but on the other hand , it is said that they were not able to deal with the enemy .
It is highly evaluated that the modern independence of Japan was protected due to the fact that it was close to the unbroken revolutionary revolution , because it was close to the unbroken revolutionary revolution , so that it was a great achievement in the Restoration of the Meiji Restoration .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed during the time of the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and even after the Meiji Restoration .
In the last days of Yoshinobu , Shibusawa tried to compile the biography of Yoshinobu , and persuaded Yoshinobu , who was astonished and asked him to listen to Naoyoshi 's talent .
The book was compiled in the " " Konjaku Yumeji hikki " ( Diary of a Dream ) .
According to a part of the Dankai , it is written in the form of a meeting , and it can be said that there are some voices of Yoshinobu who was an old age .
It can be guessed that at the age of time , Hisamitsu said that ' Hisamitsu SHIMAZU was not very fond of Hisamitsu SHIMAZU ' and ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was not a man of good luck . '
Based on these materials , the book was completed after Yoshinobu died , and it was " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA " ( Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) .
In order to show gratitude for the Emperor Meiji , who was the highest rank of the kazoku ( peerage ) and the highest rank of kazoku ( peerage ) was given to the Emperor Meiji , Yoshinobu left a will to perform the Shinshiki ( ritual ceremony ) , instead of a Buddhist ritual .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was not found in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Zojo - ji Temple , which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family , and a round barrow similar to that of the Imperial family was built in Tanaka Cemetery .
This was due to the fact that the imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei was inferior to that of Emperor Komei ( according to " Tokawa Yoshinobu Oden " ) .
Katsukiyo ITAKURA , a roju ( member of the shogun 's council of elders ) at that time said that Yoshinobu loved his life as a former retainer of the Tokugawa shogunate who had offered his life after he was pardoned , and said , ' Even if Yoshinobu was in love with him , he regretted himself with Yoshinobu . '
In the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , there was a weak image of ' enemy escape ' in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , but after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , it has been reevaluated in recent years and has been reviewed by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Taiga drama ) .
As with his father , Nariaki , he was fond of pork in the Satsuma Domain , and he was called ' Buda Ichi - sama ' or ' Ichiba - sama ' of Satsuma Domain .
In his later years , he was interested in literary works in Western countries , and he was fond of photographic photographs and fishing and his hobbies such as bicycles , bicycle carp , bracking , and handicraft , but it seems that during the time of the shogun when he learned French language from Shuzo NISHII ( Keimo ) and others .
It is famous as a camera many , but it seems that the technique of camera filming was not progressed .
He often wrote photographic magazine , but it is said that he did not adopt it .
In addition , his great - grandson Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA was a cameraman , and his photograph which was owned by the Yoshinobu family was discovered by Yoshinobu was discovered and published by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA .
He was a friend of his hobbies and was a younger brother of Akitake TOKUGAWA .
On December 3 , 1854 , he married Mikako ICHIJO ( he changed his name to Mikako MIGA after the Meiji Restoration ) .

The entire line is included in the suburbs of large cities .
Since the Kansai Main Line has its origin as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , the official starting point is Kizu Station , but the train runs from Kyoto to Kizu ( the number of the train numbers ) , and the inbound train is the same as that of the train number .
Except for the following railway dates , it will be described in the section from Kyoto to Kizu .
The color of the line is brown ( ? ) , and it is said that the reason for the selection is that ' two ancient capitals of the capital . '

The Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) except Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) ( Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) .
The line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line , but all sections are located in Kyoto Prefecture , and there are no railway lines in Nara Prefecture .
Although the Nara Railway was originally constructed by Nara Railway , the line between Kyoto and Nara was split into a part of the Kansai Railway Company ; after it was merged into the Kansai Railway Company , it was separated from Osaka and Nagoya as a part of the Nagoya Route .
However , trains are operated from Kizu Station to the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) , while Nara Station is operated by Nara Station .
After the revision of March 13 , 1988 , JR West established the nickname of the line in each line of Urban Network ( the JR Kyoto Line and the JR Kobe Line ) , but the Nara Line was sent to see the Nara Line .
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is located on the Kintetsu Nara Line , it is sometimes referred to as ' JR Nara Line . '
In the era of Japan National Railways ( JNR ) , the Japanese National Railways ( JNR ) , the name of the information board was referred to as ' JNR Nara Line ' and the English name of the board was also written as ' JR . '
The Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Naniwa , Nara and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is the Kintetsu Kyoto Line which is in rivalry with the JR Nara Line .
While many trains operated in parallel with the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , the Nara Line had not been electrified until 1984 when JNR was electrified , and only a small local line with two cars of JNR 105 series of JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 105 were operated for a while after the electrification was electrified .
However , after JR West 's establishment of the Urban Network and after the establishment of the JR West , the four - car trains were converted into four - car trains ( six cars of six - car trains ) , and the increase of rapid trains such as ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' and so on were rapidly improved rapidly .
Today , it has a strong nature as a line of commuting and learning from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Byodo - in Temple in Uji City , where Uji City is located along the line , and Joyo City .
However , it is a circular shape on the east side of the Momoyama - Shinden section , and in the south of Joyo City , the Kintetsu Kyoto Line runs parallel in parallel with the Kyoto Line running outside the center of the town .
Although the trains of Nara Train Depot are used for Nara Train Depot of the Osaka Branch and other stations are managed by Kyoto Branch except for Kizu Station .
The J - Thru ICOCA , ICOCA , and the Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA and PiTaPa of KANSAI THRU PASS can be used at all stations .
In the south of Joyo Station , the station is a simple ticket gate that is operated by Mujin Station and is located in the south of Joyo Station .
In 1984 , the limited express ' Kuroshio ' operated between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station was abolished by the Nara Line , Sakurai Line , Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line , and until 1991 , only local trains were operated as local trains until 1991 , but nowadays there are four types of local trains that were operated between Miyakoji Station and Rapid trains , Rapid trains , Rapid and local trains that were operated between Kyoto and Wakayama .
It is the nearest type of the Nara Line , and is mainly operated during the daytime mainly during the daytime .
Basically , a local train connects with a local train and a local train at Uji Station due to the intervention of 30 minutes .
The nickname of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was decided by the public before the operation started .
Many of the trains that connect Kyoto and Nara , which are tourist spots , use not only Japanese but also foreigners , but also for tourists .
All the trains are operated by JR West , which are operated with four - car trains or six cars of the JR West .
The maximum speed of the double - track section is 110 km / h and the maximum speed is operated at 110 km / h , and the speed is 95 km / h other than that is 95 km / h.
Approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara , and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Nara .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamitakoma Station or Tanakura Station in the middle of the station , and there are some differences between the inbound and outbound trains that run between Nara and Nara .
During the three days of the new year , Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station in order to visit Fushimi Inari Station .
History
March 3 , 2001 : The operation began operating .
March 15 , 2003 : Due to the revision of the timetable revision , the station began to stop at Tofukuji Station and Tamamizu Station .
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours .
It also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) .
All trains are operated in the Series 221 and are operated with four - car trains or six cars .
Basically , a local train connects with a local train and a local train at Uji Station due to the intervention of 30 minutes .
In the same way as the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above , the Yamatoji Line rapid trains stop at Hirayama Station , which is operated by the Yamatoji Line .
The stops of ' Miyakoji Rapid Service appeared in March 2001 when ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' appeared in March 2001 , and JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 was used in Kyoto and Uji , Kizu and Nara , but they were not used in the Nara Line after that .
In the morning and evening , there are trains that directly connect the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line .
It is mainly operated in the morning and night .
At first , only weekdays , they were operated on weekdays , but they were operated on Saturday and holidays due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 18 , 2006 .
Although trains stop at each station between Uji Station and Nara Station , there was a rapid train bound for Kizu in the vicinity of midnight due to the difference between the local trains bound for Uji Station and the local trains running in the vicinity of the station , but nowadays it was changed to a train that ran before the local rapid train stopped at this station .
There are some trains that use JNR 103 series JNR 103 from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays , and all trains are operated on the 221 series 21 .
During the morning rush hours , trains run directly from the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line .
As rapid trains on the Nara Line tried to avoid mistakes with rapid trains in the Yamatoji Line , the color of oranges was used as a line color , but due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 2008 , the type of rapid train in the section was used as a green and the color of the section was not used as a color .
In the postmark of the station on the north side of Kamikoma Station , it is described as a purple letter .
It runs between Kyoto Station and Uji , Joyo and Nara Station .
During the daytime the section between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station runs between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station , but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station is operated between Joyo Station and 30 minutes .
Basically , trains are operated on the 103 series cars , but some trains are operated on the 221 Line .
In the early morning and late evening , there are trains that directly connect the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late evening .
In the past , there was a direct train with the Sakurai Line , but on September 4 , 1994 , the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines : the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line .
Although it was a special train , limited express trains were sometimes operated on the Nara Line .
From 1987 to 1988 , the train was operated via the Kansai Main Line and the Hanwa Line via the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line of the Kansai Main Line and the Hanwa Line via the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line using 381 series ' Kuroshio ' in 1988 to 1989 .
In the Kinki Shinbun Newspaper published on January 6 , 1998 , there was an announcement that the limited express would run on the Nara Line with 381 series of series 381 ( commuter trains ) , but the plan was stopped after that .
Although it was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai ( Miyakoji Rapid Service operated between Kyoto Station and Nara Station ) as the Miyakoji Route , there were no direct trains to the Sakurai Line except for special purposes .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Fireworks Festival , which is the nearest to Uji Station , is operated in a special schedule from 16:00 a.m. to the final timetable , and only local trains run between Kyoto and Uji only 10 minutes .
There are some local trains that arrive at and depart from Kizu Station .
The special timetable for the New Year 's Day at that time became completely different and the rapid trains stopped at each station between Kyoto and Uji Station , and the number of trains was increased to the Uji Station .
Depending on the year , there were some trains that came back to Momoyama Station .
In 1992 , direct trains bound for the Sakurai Line extended the regular rapid service to the Sakurai Line mainly on Saturdays and holidays , and one hour was operated between Tenri Station and Tenri Station .
In addition , there are cases where special trains that are operated by a group are operated from all over Japan .
Particularly , when the Tenri Religious Festival held every October 26 , the trains called ' special trains for the Tenri Line ' are operated between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station on the Nara Line and the Yamatoji Line between Nara Station and Nara Station and Sakurai Line .
All of them belonged to Nara Train Depot .

Keiji Bypass is a bypass of National Highway Route from Kusatsu City , Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama - cho , Kuse - gun , Kyoto Prefecture .
It is designated as a plan for regional high - standards .
The following is the section on the Keiji Bypass of the Uryo Road and the Keiji Bypass of National Route 1 and National Route 24 .
It has been integrated with the Meishin Expressway , and it is connected with the Kuridashi Interchange of the Meishin Expressway , Nagoya City and Osaka City Interchange .
By the law , the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama Yodo Interchange are designated as National Highway Route 1 and National Route 478 , and the Kumiyama Interchange ( Keiji Bypass ) , the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange and Oyamazaki Junction , based on National Highway 478 and National Highway Route 478 , the Taki Expressway ( exclusive of the National Highway Highway Expressway ) is designated as the National Highway Highway Highway Route No . 478 and the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Road ( Keiji Belt Expressway ) , and the National Highway Route No . 2 and the National Highway Highway Highway Route No . 2 are designated as the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Road and the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Route No . 2 and the Oyamazaki Interchange is the National Highway Highway Route No . 78 and the National Highway Route No . 2 and the National Highway Highway Highway Route No . 2 and the Yodo Interchange of the National Highway Road is the National Highway Highway Highway Route No . 2 and the Yodo Interchange of the National Highway Highway Road
As the plan was planned later , the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway was built in order to improve the delay of the Meishin Expressway and the construction of roads that had functions of Kyoto City and Kyoto City , the Kyoto Bypass connecting the Kyoto Tanba Road and the Keiji Bypass which were National Route 9 was a bypass of National Highway Route 9 .
The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway have been designated National Highway 478 and maintained consistently .
In the indication of the line , it is considered to be a Keiji Bypass in the Seta Higashi CTT - Oyamazaki JT , which is easy to understand the users of the route .
In addition , the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass are not differently different from the ETC system .
According to this article , Keiji Bypass ( from the Seta Higashi Interchange to Oyamazaki JCT ) , which is the name of the business route , will be described as the Keiji Bypass .

August 29 , 1988 : The Seta Higashi Interchange and JCT - JC - JC - JT - CT / Ogura - Interchange were opened .
March 30 , 2003 : The Oguraiko Interchange - Kumiyama JC - TS opened .
As a result , the tolling system was unified by the other Nippon Road Public Corporation ( today 's Network ) .
August 10 , 2003 : The entire line was opened as a result of the opening of the section between Kumiyama JCT and Oyamazaki JCT .

The Uji Tunnel is the longest 4,313 meters in the National Route 1 , and the tunnels are prohibited except for 500 meters before the Uji - higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange .
Before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction , the film was filmed in the film " Dancing for dancing , EM , EV II " before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction .
When the distance between Seta Interchange and Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT , the Keiji Bypass is shorter than the Meishin Expressway , the Keiji Bypass is more shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and if it runs on the maximum speed of the maximum speed of the station , the Keiji Bypass runs earlier than the Keiji Bypass via the Keiji Bypass .
Since there are no resting facilities such as the service area , the Meishin Expressway is often crowded with the congestion of the Meishin Expressway , and the rest of the rest of the Meishin Expressway is the Otsu Service Area , the Oyamazaki Rest Area and the Katsuragawa Park .
However , the structure of both the Seta and Oyamazaki JCT , which were established after the name of the god , is a very complicated structure ( especially the structure of the JCTTT of Oyamazaki JCT , which is a very complicated structure , has a complicated structure , is the same as that of the road in which the road is operated by the area where the road is operated by the OYamazaki Junction .
When you go from Oyamazaki JTT to Suita and Osaka from the Oyamazaki JT , there is an inconvenience that you can get along the Meishin Expressway and the left side of the Meishin Expressway .
In addition , since the curve and the sloping road have continued , the road has not always functioned as a bypass of the Meishin Expressway .
As this road is a bypass of National Route 1 ( general national road ) , this road is an exclusive road for Jidoshado Expressway , and it is not a high - speed Expressway .
In the case of the Keiji Bypass from the east side of the Uji - gawa River , it is necessary to travel from the east side of the Uji - gawa River , to the Keiji Bypass in the direction of the Uji - gawa River .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is an alternative IC for the Uji - higashi Interchange .
For this reason , the general road section between the Uji Higashi Interchange and the Uji Nishi Interchange is often traffic during the time of commution .
This general road section is located in the direction of the VISR , so it is difficult to measure the traffic delay .

Amaterasu Omikami is a god ( human ) appearing in Japanese mythology .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , when it was enshrined as a god of nature , it is called ' Ameteru . '
It is one of the deities that deify the sun and are considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial family .
In the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it is written as 天照大神神 ( 天照大神 ) in the Kojiki ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , and in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) it is written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
He was also called Ohirume no Muchi no Kami .
In the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , several gods were described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , but in the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , it was unified by the name of the god called ' Tensho Daijin ' in the name of the god .
Although she was a goddess , there is a theory that she was actually a male god .
Since the name of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as " Kotai Jingu Gishiki , " it is said that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and became the ancestor of the Imperial family .
In the Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amazume no Okami or Sumeramikami , or when the name of the god is enshrined before the festival , it is also referred to as Amateruimasu no kami or Amenosakasume - no - kami when the god is enshrined .
In academic documents today , the word ' Amaterasu ' and katakana are used as a custom .
There is a theory that it was written as 天照太神 .
The description in mythology
According to the " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , when Izanagi came back from the land of Izanami , he was born when he washed off the impurities of the dead and washed his left eyes .
At that time , he was born from the right eye and was born from the nose , together with Susanoo who was born from the nose , and was called Mikoshi ( three noble children ) .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to govern Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susanoo who was entrusted to Kaibara continued to cry that he would go to Nenokuni where Izanami had lived , so he was expelled by Izanami .
Susanoo met his older sister , Amaterasu Omikami , before he went to Nenokuni ( the Nine Kingdom ) and went to Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , but Amateru Oomikami thought that his younger brother would take over Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) and waited for him .
In order to prove the purity of Susanoo , the three goddesses were born from the real power of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) to the five pillars , and Susanoo declared the victory .
He was born from the real power of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and was regarded as a child of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and the following five deities are deities of the following five gods .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Hikutsuhikone
Kusunokuten
Susano who was frightened by this , worked hard in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amaterasu Omikami hid herself in Ama no Iwato ( heavenly rock cave ) .
In the middle of the world , there were various misfortunes in the world .
( The eight hundred million deities such as Yagorogi no mikoto and Amenokoyane no mikoto succeeded in making Amaterasu Omikami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , the god of Chichibu - no - kami , and Susanoo was expelled from Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
He sent his son Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) .
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) was pacified , Amenooshihomimi descended after Ninigi was born , and Ninigi descended from his grandson Ninigi .
interpretation
In the mythology , there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be the god of the nation because he showed his actions in Amatsukami ( Takamimusubi no mikoto ) who was born earlier than himself or in the mythology , and because there is a scene in which Amaterasu Omikami was in accordance with the instructions of the god .
There is also a view that it was a deification of miko ( a shrine maiden ) in ancient times .
It is also called ' 日女 ' ( 日女女 ) or ' 日女女 ' ( 日女女女 ) and refers to miko who served the sun god .
The sun god was originally a male god , but there is a theory that the shrine maiden who served was identified with the sun god was identified with the sun god and became a goddess .
There is also a theory that this goddess was established in the era of Empress Jito , who was a female emperor , and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
It is pointed out that the birth of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and Tsukuyomi no kami ( the god of Tsukuyomi ( the sun goddess ) was based on the strong influence of Taoism in the " Ryoho Gopu " ( the fifth century before the sixth century ) , which was written in the " Ryoho Gofu " ( the first half of the sixth century ) , in the " Ryoho Gofu " ( the first half of the seventh century ) , a Buddhist sutra of Taoism , and a sutra of the Taoism ( before the seventh century ) , and in the beginning of the seventh century , the seventh century , it is pointed out that it was a strong influence of Taoism .
In addition , the belief that Ise - jingu Shrine enshrines Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , the Ise - jingu Shrine , the Saigu , the Saigu , and the Saikan ( vestment ) of the Saikan , the Shigi no Mura no Miyatsuko , the Miginu ( purification ) , and Usuki - sagi ( white silk fabric ) are divided into the names of the five colors of the gods , and the Taoism is consistently divided into the names of the Ojingu Shrine and the Ojingu Shrine .
According to comparative mythology , the birth mythology of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is almost equal to that of the ancient mythological mythological mythology which records the ancient period ( 3 to 4 centuries ) , which records the oldest period of time ( 3 to 4 centuries ) .
Also , there is a myth that it is regarded as the day of the solar calendar , because it spread to Japan along with the ethnic groups in the earlier history .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the shrine was transformed into the third stage .
The following is a summary of the incident and the contents of the movement .
645 : Taika Reforms
Before that , the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Hijin no kami ' ( 日神神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ) ( 日神 ' ( 日神 ) ( 日神 )
A male god called ' Ameru , ' was widely enshrined there .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines such as ' Akamasu - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima , ' Issunimasu - jinja Shrine ' in Harima , and ' Amiteru ' in Tanba .
For reference , it is another name for Amenohoakari who was a grandson of Amaterasu , and Amenohoakari is also the founder of the Owari clan , the Tsunamori clan , and the Kaibe clan .
In addition , the younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi and the great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : The Jinshin War
Ohihirume no Muchi no Muchi no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Muchime ' or ' Tanatatsutatsume '
In this case , the enshrined deity is interpreted as Ohirume no Sumeramikoto , who is a goddess , and there is an interpretation that it is the ' ameteru ' of a snake .
698 : Kotai - jingu Shrine was established .
Amaterasu ( the Sun Goddess ) and ' the ancestor of the Imperial family . '
She was a goddess .
Emperor Jito was modeled after the Emperor Jito , and it was created from a natural god to a humanity god .
After that , ' heaven ' other than Koto - shin was called ' amateru . '
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( The Sarashina Diary ) , it is written as ' 天照御神 ' ( 1060 ) , and the part of ' 天照神 ' is read as ' Ameru , ' and also in ' Amatsuhirume ' in " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
1880 - 1881 , a fierce controversy occurred over the enshrined deities of the Shinto Jimukyoku Bureau in Hibiya , Tokyo .
The Shinto Jimukyoku insisted that the three deities were enshrined as the enshrined deities of the Bureau of Divinities ( Amenominakanushi no Kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Kamimusubi no kami ) , and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) should be enshrined in this world , but ' Izumo school ' should be combined with ' Yuiken ' ( the world ) .
However , the ' Ise school ' which was the center of Shinto Jimukyoku was the ' presidence ' that Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) ruled the two worlds of Kenyu and insisted that other deities were not subject to subject .
In the end , there were various theories , such as ' the Izumo school had a grudge that had continued since the age of the gods , and the Imperial family should kill Senke Sonfuku , who had a bad mind in the Imperial family . '
Before long , the controversy was resolved due to the decision of Emperor Meiji and the Izumo school was defeated , and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was positioned as the highest rank .
It is said that the government recognized that it was impossible to control the people directly through the Fukushin Shinto .
Refer to the controversy of the enshrined deities of State Shinto Jimukyoku ( the Bureau of Shinto Shrines ) .
When Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA introduced Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) in his own novel , he used another name ' Ohirume no Sumeru ' ( also known as Ohirume no Ki ) .
Since the term ' Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess)'Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) does not appear in the word , the sun god or a natural god , and the word ' 大日日日日日比売神 ' ( 日日日日日比売神 ) could not be used as ' 大日日比売神 ' ( 大日日日比売神 ) because the name of the sun god appears in the text .
In fact , there are many novels written by AKUTAGAWA who were not able to revise the corrections and revisions of the army .
In 1926 , Masaatsu YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) founded the Kinkei Gakuin School , ' Japan has a belief in Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is an ideal to make the world light .
When ' Izanagi ' and ' Izanagi ' were used , they were the pioneers of the world and became an ideal person for the people who were the pioneers of the world . '
Shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami
The shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami are called Kamimeijinja Shrines throughout the country and the main shrine is the inner shrine ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) of the Jingu Shrine ( Ise - jingu Shrine ) .
The Kotai - jingu Shrine is a Shinto shrine that enshrines Yata no kagami , one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family .
In most shrines throughout Japan , the shinsatsu of Kotai - jingu Shrine ( Ame no Kotai - jingu Shrine ) is distributed in most shrines throughout Japan .

Daimyo in the Edo period
The daimyo in the Edo period were determined according to kakaku ( family status ) and kokudaka ( crop yield ) and shikoseki ( family status of a daimyo in the Edo period ) in the Edo period .
Firstly , due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family , it was classified as tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) who served the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara , mainly fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who was a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara and became a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara .
When the shogun family became extinct , the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of Tokugawa family ) , which were allowed to use the Tokugawa family as well as the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , were established in order to keep the bloodline of the shogun family and to supervise the control of the whole country and to support the shogunate , and the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was allowed to use the Tokugawa family name of the Tokugawa family , was established , and the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA , the Owari Domain and the tenth son Yorinobu TOKUGAWA was appointed to the Mito Domain and the 11th son of the Kishu Domain .
In addition , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to the Echizen Domain as well as daimyo ( feudal lord ) of the Tokugawa clan throughout the country .
In addition , the fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who had established the foundation of the Tokugawa Shogun family were placed as fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and he was appointed important posts centered on roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) at the beginning of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) to support the shogunate government .
Although the Ii clan , the head of Fudai ( fudai daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) of the Ii clan , had a large amount of fief of 35 thousand koku , the Torii clan , the Sakakibaraki clan , the Honda clan , and the Ogasawara clan gained a relatively large amount of territories in the Edo period , the Sakai clan , the Abe clan , the Abe clan , the Horiizawa clan , the Yanagimoto clan , and so on , and only a few fudai daimyo who maintained more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period .
This came to be used for separation of power and military power .
The tozama daimyo were daimyo who were subordinate to the Tokugawa family after the Battle of Sekigahara , and many families fought against the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara .
On the other hand , the caution of the bakufu was strong , and he actively actively acted as intelligent activities , and he was severely punished by being punished by being deprived of his fief when he was afraid of his misfortunes or rebellion .

In addition , the status of daimyo was divided according to the social status of daimyo ( daimyo ) who had more than one koku or more than one koku or more than one koku of kokudaka ( crop yield ) which was equivalent to that of kokushu ( lord of a castle ) , and those with a castle were called joshukaku ( daimyo ) ( joshukaku ( lord of a castle ) or jinya ( daimyo who were not allowed to participate in the Edo Castle .
For more information , refer to the article on the shikoseki ( seats for vassals of the Tokugawa shogunate ) .
Daimyo were not allowed to have the status of daimyo ( feudal lord ) , and the daimyo with 100,000 koku was not allowed to have the whole territory of the land , and most of them had territories in the vicinity of the castle town .
In extreme cases , one village was divided into other feudal lords and governed one village ( shokyu [ salary ] ) .
Although daimyo were more than 10,000 koku ( crop yields ) , the Kitsuregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was worth 5,000 koku .
This was because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan .
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the Buke Shohatto ( regulations for samurai families ) and the Sankinkotai system ( a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In addition , in the end of the Edo period , daimyo were appointed to the officer who was called Ote - denyaku ( job of guarding the coast of the sea ) or the defense of the seashore because they were ordered to defend the coast , they were always in financial difficulties .
The word " daimyo " refers to daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) .

Like daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) , a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) , it was a kind of hawk like daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) .
Daimyo daimyo - gyoretsu ( daimyo 's procession of daimyo in the Edo period ) was formed by daimyo in the Sankinkotai system ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .

In the dictionaries of the Muromachi period , two sounds of ' taimei ' ( taimei ) and ' daimyo ' ( daimyo ) were used , and the former was called ' taimei ' ( taimei ) or ' daimyo ' ( big feudal lord ) , and the latter meant ' zenji ( rich people ) . '
In the Sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , it is said that the distinction of the meaning of the sound was weak , and it was often called ' taimei ' ( taimei ) .
In the Japanese - Portuguese dictionary written in the early 17th century , two sounds of ' daimyo ' and ' taimei ' were used , but the distinction of the word is not clear , and they are regarded as major feudal lords .
