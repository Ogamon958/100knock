There is also a theory that Michichika 's son MINAMOTO no Michimune , MINAMOTO no Michimune , and Michiteru KOGA were his father .
According to " <unk> " ( The Record of the <unk> ) , which was a biography of his father ( Michichika ) , he lost his mother at the age of three , and was adopted by his older paternal half - brother , Michitomo HORIKAWA .
According to one theory , after the death of his parents , he wanted to adopt his maternal uncle Moroie MATSUDONO ( former regent and minister of the Interior ) , who was his maternal uncle , to be adopted by the Matsudono family , but it is also said that Dogen , who felt the impermanence of the world , declined .

Many of the Kamakura Buddhism agreed to the Mappo - shiso ( the end of the Dharma ) , but " Shobogenzo " describes that ' we can see this word , " " <unk> , " and this word is not necessarily a true way .
It is a hoben ( a method of teaching ) for a while , which means to stand the <unk> ( a three - syllable Japanese character ) .
The truth of the story is only the truth .
I should have been able to gather all things .
He was always good at the time of a priest .
There is also a deep - looking mind that looks like a mysterious man , and a gentle mind .
It is to mean that Buddha , precepts , and so on are <unk> and <unk> .
All the people became a Buddhist priest .
He pointed out that he could not be able to be able to do anything , and that he could not be able to do anything , and that he could not always be good at disciples of Shakyamuni , and denied Mappo ( the end of the Edo period ) as a result of the theory of hoben ( the way of the Lotus Sutra ) .

Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a storage facility for the steam locomotive operated by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) in <unk> - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
On October 10 , 1972 , the Japan National Railways started its 100th anniversary of its opening , and it was founded to use a fan - shaped facility in Umekoji Ward , Kyoto City , which was a facility of Umekoji Engine Depot , which was a Japanese National Railways , and for a century , it was the first Japanese facility to preserve its steam locomotives that had been supported by Japan 's railway transportation .
In 1987 , JR West succeeded the position of the JR West due to the division and privatization of Japan National Railways .
This facility is also a regular car ( Umekoji Ward ) , and it is also conducted by JNR Diesel Locomotive , which is owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway , as well as the 10 National Railways ( JNR ) diesel locomotives .
The reason why this facility was established was to be to preserve steam locomotives , which had rapidly disappeared from the late 1960 's .
At first , Oyama Ward , which was located in Oyama Station , Tochigi Prefecture , was the most likely candidate for preservation of the body , but it was located in the ' central part of Japan ' and therefore , Umekoji Ward ( at that time ) was officially selected as a ' historic site ' in 1970 , because it was located in the area .
The object of storage was generally examined by selecting the oldest car ( if possible ) of the existing existing cars ( one - car ) , but some of the cars were initially not planned to be preserved as the C62 C62 C62 Type 2 .
The facilities were " Steam Locomotive Museum " which used the <unk> and a <unk> of the former Umekoji Engine Depot , " and " Materials Exhibition Museum " that was relocated and reconstructed the former Nijo Station building .
The <unk> - ro was a reinforced concrete structure constructed in 1914 , and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the line .
It was preserved for the Civil Engineering Heritage in 2004 .
In 2006 , the former Nijo Station building ( exhibition hall ) , a <unk> - shiki ( steam locomotive ) and a set of tools for steam locomotives and repairs were designated as a quasi - railway monument .
The former Nijo Station building was constructed in 1904 by imitating Heian - jingu Shrine , in consideration of its scenery , in consideration of its construction , with the oldest wooden building of the existing Japanese existing in Japan , which was constructed by the Kyoto Railway Company as its headquarters .
The Kyoto Railway was nationalized in 1907 , and it was later used as a station building of JR West , but in 1996 , the station was completed as a station building , and the station was reconstructed and reconstructed as a main building , and the interior of the main building was reconstructed in 1997 , and the ticket room was used as a museum .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
The <unk> - <unk> - ro was a Japanese steam locomotive with 16 locomotives ( 16 cars in the form of 16 cars ) produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period , which were produced by the Taisho period .
At the beginning of the opening , there were two types of cars , and the cars were registered in 15 cars , except for the two cars of <unk> and <unk> , but later , the subject of the storage cars were reviewed several times , and the preservation machine has been reorganized into 7 - ryo in 2006 .
Among the five cars , five cars are still registered , and two cars ( <unk> , C56 <unk> , 56 <unk> ) are served on the main line of the Yamaguchi Line , such as ' Yamaguchi ( train ) ' ( train ) , ' Kita Biwako ( train ) ' ( north Biwako ) ' and so on .
Although there are some <unk> other than these two locomotives , it is impossible to run on the main line because it is not fully inspected .
The ' SL Steam Locomotive <unk> ' operated by the steam locomotive for display in the museum is also operated by the railway .
This display route was once extended from the depot to the north of the site ( where a rest facility and park were once used ) , but was moved to the north of the site ( the former Nijo Station building building and the park ) , and it was changed to the present Umekoji - cho , which was then relocated to the site of the former Nijo Station building , and then the Umekoji - koen Park was built along the Sagano Line .
It is still connected with the operation line as a facility .
After the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company was closed , it was also maintained by steam locomotives .
Ume - ume ( plum )
It originates from ' Ume ' ( plum ) which means Umekoji .
All of the cars of C62 <unk> , which had been designated as the C62 <unk> in 1976 , are designated as quasi - quasi - quasi - railway monuments along with the <unk> of the car and the <unk> of the conservative tools in 2006 .
The procedure to transfer the former organization organization from the former affiliated ward was taken in 1972 , unless otherwise specified .
The left - hand priest has no registered car since it has been preserved in Umekoji .

Shomyo is one of the Japanese traditional music .
It is a religious music used for rituals in Buddhist scriptures and Buddhist scriptures .
In Japan , it is also called <unk> or <unk> .
In old style , it is written as <unk> .
It is one of the ancient Indian studies fields .
The term " Shomyo " refers to five fields of learning : Shomyo ( phonology , grammar , grammar , and grammar ) , <unk> ( science ) , <unk> ( learning ) , Inmyo ( learning ) , Inmyo ( learning ) ( ethics ) , and <unk> ( ethics ) , and <unk> ( ethics ) , and Buddhist scholars ) .
It was introduced to Japan with Buddhism introduced .
In 754 , a Buddhist memorial service for Buddhist memorial service was held at the time of the Kaigen - hoyo ( ceremony to consecrate the Great Buddha ) of Todai - ji Temple , and it is believed that Shomyo was actively practiced in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai transmitted the Buddhist Shomyo ( Buddhist hymns ) and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo ( the Tendai chant ) and the mantra Shomyo ( the Shingon chant ) .
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect also have their own Buddhist Shomyo , and they still have been handed down to the present day .
The chanting of the Buddhist hymns was passed down by the <unk> , so the score was not provided .
Therefore , the initiation of the school was extremely difficult .
Later , the score of the score was invented .
In addition , there are differences in the technical terms of hakase , such as hakase , depending on each school .
However , the meaning of hakase is a reference to the chanting of the Buddhist hymns , and if to learn the chanting of the Buddhist hymns , it is necessary to have oral instructions ( or <unk> ) ( or to teach the teaching ) , and it is necessary to maintain and inherit the school from the teacher to his disciples .
Therefore , the training of the instructors and successors was required .
With various conditions , many schools were abolished .
Tendai Shomyo was founded by Saicho , and developed its own style .
After Saicho , Ennin and <unk> were built to flourish .
Ryonin , the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu , is known as the restorer of the Yuzu Nenbutsu .
In 1109 , Ryonin built Raigo - in Temple ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) in Ohara , Kyoto .
The sango ( literally , " mountain name " ) of Ohara is the title prefixed to the name of the Buddhist temple , which is the origin of Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) in China , and was called <unk> .
Later , two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the training hall of Ohara School Shomyo Shomyo .
In addition , <unk> HARA later had no school and had a statement of the two schools in Ohara .
Later , the temple was restored by <unk> .
The temple built a new school based on the theory of music .
After that , the central part of the Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) was held , and it was handed down to the present Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu sect , Jodo sect and Jodo Shinshu sect chant are the lineage of Tendai Shomyo .
The mantra chanting of the Shingon sect is based on Kukai 's tradition , and has been passed down to the present day .
The form of Shomyo was systematized after Shinga .
It is said that Kancho was the founder of the renaissance .
He worked for the music and maintenance of Shomyo ( Buddhist hymns ) .
Until the Kamakura period , there were many schools , but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakuho to four schools ( the <unk> - ryu , the Shin - <unk> - ryu , the Daigo - ryu , the <unk> - ryu , and the Nakagawa - ryu ) .
The reading of Kogi Shingon Sect was abolished by the Edo period .
The <unk> - ryu , Shin - in - in - <unk> - ryu and Daigo - ryu schools were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
Currently , it is divided into <unk> Shomyo ( Chishaku - in Temple in Kyoto ) , <unk> Shomyo ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) ( Hase - dera Temple ) , <unk> ( Mt. Koya , Kyoto / Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The Buddhist Shomyo ( Buddhist chant ) of Chisan School of the Shingon sect , Buzan Shomyo ( Shingi Shingon sect ) , Buzan school , Buzan school of the Shingon sect , and both schools were originally derived from the Nakagawa Daishin - ryu School .
Raiyu adopted the school of Daigo .
In 1583 , when Negoro - ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI , both Chisan and Buzan schools fell into decline , and they formed a group based on the old school of Daigo .
Its characteristics are the ' debate ' of Buzan 's Buzan school ' and ' Shomyo ' ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) .
The Nakagawa School of the <unk> School ( Kogi Shingon sect ) was based on the Nakagawa School of the <unk> School .
The Nakagawa Daishin - ryu school was founded by the senior official of Nakagawa - ji Temple in Nara .
In the Joei era ( 1232 - 1233 ) , the base of Koyasan <unk> and Sanboin Temples of Mt. Koya was moved to Mt. Koya .
Later , he was called Mt. Koya , and was named Nanzan - san , which was the name of Mt. Koya .
It is also called the <unk> School or the <unk> School .
The music of Heikyoku , Yokyoku , folk songs , Joruri , etc . can be used as Shomyo .
It had a significant influence on the melody of hitoe - like music .
Emperor Tenchi ( also known as Emperor Tenchi )

Emperor Suiko : 626 - January 7 , 672
The 38th Emperor .
The Japanese posthumous name of the Japanese provincial government was <unk> no Mikoto .
His imina ( personal name ) was Kazuraki .
It is believed that he was called Katsuragi no Miko ( Prince Kazuraki ) or Katsuragi no Miko ( Prince Kazuraki ) during his lifetime .
He is generally known as Naka no Oe no Oji .
The term ' Oe ' means the crown prince , and the word ' Naka no Oe ' means ' the next Crown Prince . '
Overview
He was the second Prince of Emperor Jomei .
His mother was Takara no Himemiko ( later Empress Kogyoku ) .
The empress was Yamatohime no Okimi , a daughter of Furuhito no Oe no Miko , who was her half brother by a different mother .
He conspired with NAKATOMI no Kamatari and others to kill SOGA no Iruka , and he raised his uncle , Emperor Kotoku , to succeed to the throne , and he himself became the Crown Prince .
He established the era name Taika and implemented various reforms ( the central figure of the Taika Reforms , the Isshi Incident ) .
He also caused a coup d'etat by <unk> such as Arima no miko and tried to be executed by setting a trap .
Because Baekje was destroyed by Tang Dynasty China and Silla in 660 , he sent Buyeo Pung , a prince of Baekje , who was staying in the Imperial Court , to restore Baekje .
He stayed in Chikushi for the help of Baekje , but in 661 , Empress Saimei died ( died ) .
After that , he did not succeed to the Imperial Throne for a long time , but after a crushing defeat in the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663 , he moved the capital to Otsu City and ascended the throne .
After the Battle of Hakusukinoe , Mizuki ( a Mizuki ) , signal fire , and Sakimori ( soldiers who guarded the Imperial Court ) were established as part of the policy of defense of the land .
The official rank system was also implemented from the 19th rank to the 26th floor .

Brief Personal History
626 - born .
June 14 , 645 : He became the Crown Prince .
August 24 , 661 - Shosei ( official Shosei )
January 3 , 668 - The enthronement of the Emperor
He died at the age of 46 on January 7 , 672 .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief Brief History of Japan ) , it is said that ' Emperor Tenmu was killed by the Emperor 's army , <unk> YAMASHINA , who was the Emperor 's horse , and the Emperor Tenmu 's side was missing in the mountains because I will not kill the Emperor . '
The reason why Emperor Tenchi did not ascend the throne for a long time was one of the mysterious histories of politics in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories on this .
This was because of consideration for the power of Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , Emperor Tenmu , who had been considered an established theory , was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is based on the theory that he was a son of the Han Imperial Prince who gave birth to Emperor Jomei before he married Emperor Jomei , and that he was a maternal half - brother of Emperor Tenchi .
In fact , if counting backwards from the year of Emperor Tenmu 's birth in the history of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , the year of birth is based on the description of Emperor Tenchi 's death , Tenmu becomes the oldest person .
However , there are no contradictions between the same historical materials , and there are many historical materials that have the age of 8 to 9 .
In contrast , there is a negative opinion that " although the father is different , the older brother will be sent to his older brother , " and therefore , the age of Emperor Tenchi was described in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the age of Emperor Jomei was at the age of 16 , which was the age of Emperor Jomei , who was the father of Emperor Jomei , who was enthroned , died .
Therefore , the real year of birth was 614 , which was adopted by the Imperial Family , such as the " Honcho koin jounroku " ( the Emperor 's family tree ) .
The argument that " In ancient times , " the vacant vacant position was not uncommon ( actually , Emperor Tenchi and Jito , who reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu , also had no reign , also had no enthronement and did not immediately succeed to the throne .
The error of the letter was caused by the error .
There is also a view that the theory of " Nihonshoki " was pointed out as " the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the other historical books were compiled in different periods , so some say that they were not identical .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age ' )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat by Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Prince Naka no Oe was driven out of power .
Recently , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good , and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of the Prince Naka no Oe .
Thus , Prince Naka no Oe 's motive for killing Iruka was not realized .
The description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) was also recognized as a revised version , so this theory was also advocated .
In this theory , the Soga clan other than Iruka was not purged after the coup d'etat , and the other reasons are also attracting attention to the public because the Soga clan , other than Iruka , were not purged .
The theory that the enthronement of the Emperor Tenchi was delayed because of the opposition from the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi .
This is because Emperor Kotoku , who was described in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , indicated that she and Emperor Tenchi 's adultery relationship with her wife Hashihito no Himemiko ( younger maternal half - sister of Emperor Tenchi ) .
Although his love and marriage were permitted by her paternal half - brother , she was not allowed to be allowed to be allowed to love people in those days , but it was interpreted that she was actually related to the <unk> of the heavens , and she was persuaded by her uncle Karu no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) , who had married her husband , and she was surprised to see Arima no miko , who was very angry .
After the death of Empress Saimei , Hashihito no Himemiko succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the empress of the previous emperor , but some people say that the records were deleted in the past .
This is because the " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) states that the person who became ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' came from Hashihito no Himemiko , and the ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' is an emperor who is the interim emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .
If Hashihito no Himemiko is called ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' , there is a theory that says that she was the Empress Saimei , but there is no evidence of this .
It is difficult to prove the nature and the nature of political history , and the purpose of the research of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the research is expected .

The Saionji family was a court noble family that descended from the Fujiwara clan .
The family was descended from the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan , and its social standing was the Seiga family .
The Toin family and the Imadegawa family ( Kikutei family ) were divided into two families : the Saionji family .
The Saionji clan of the samurai family in Iyo Province was also a powerful branch of the Saionji family , who used the family name of Saionji .
The family crest is the left - hand comma - shaped mitsudomoe .
The Saionji family originated from FUJIWARA no Suemichi , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane .
When Kintsune SAIONJI , the great - grandson of Michisue , married MINAMOTO no Yoritomo 's niece , he was taken under suspicion of being confined by the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) during the Jokyu War , and after that , he gained the trust of the bakufu and gained real power as Kanto moshitsugi ( liaison officer in the Kanto region ) and was raised to Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) .
The family name of Saionji originated from the temple 's name which Kintsune built in his second residence in Kyoto ( Kitayama - sho , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono , and the present Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA by transferring this land from the Saionji family .
He was supported by the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) since Kintsune , and had power as a result of the Kamakura period to surpass the Sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) .
Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) and gave his daughter to Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
However , after his son , Kinhira SAIONJI , who was the son of the Emperor , came to place the Daikakuji - to line from the bakufu , and this led to a conflict with the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) .
Later , in the era of Kinmune SAIONJI , the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) fell and was dismissed from Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO ( Tokioki ) , who was the remnants of the Hojo clan , and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration , and planned to assassinate the Emperor Godaigo who supported the Retired Emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin - to line , and the plot was revealed by his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI , who was planning to assassinate Kinmune , and was executed .
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Sanetoshi SAIONJI , the son of Kinmune SAIONJI , served the Northern Court and went to the Udaijin ( Minister of the Right ) and restored the family name .
It was also known as a family that specialized in biwa during the Muromachi and Edo periods .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI invited Tadataka HOSOKAWA , the heir of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later disinherited ) , and his eldest daughter Tokuhime , who was not allowed to be the heir of Tadataka NAGAOKA , to become the wife of the Shogun , and he received a donation of 600 koku ( <unk> ) of the Saionji family and received a donation of funds from the Saionji family ( <unk> ) .
At the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI , who was from the Tokudaiji family of the same Kanin line , was adopted by Kinmochi SAIONJI , and after the Meiji Restoration , he was active as a politician and served as Prime Minister , and he played an important role in the political world of Taisho and Showa as a Genro ( elder statesman ) .
Incidentally , Kinmochi was not like playing biwa ( Japanese lute ) , which was supposed to be the family business of the Saionji family , but he was said to have been a prime minister , ' I wanted to listen to the biwa of the Saionji family for a long time ' and there is an episode that he was forced to play with the staff of Gagaku ( ancient Japanese court dance and music ) of the Imperial Household Ministry of the Imperial Household to play with biwa ( Japanese lute ) in the half of the year .

The following are various passages : ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , which is representative of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' ( <unk> ) , ' ( <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' ( <unk> ' ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ' ( <unk> ' ) , ' ) , ' ( <unk> ' ) , ' ( <unk> ' ( <unk> ' ) , ' ( <unk> ' ) , ' ) , which is a collection of the author of the same as well as well as ' <unk> ' <unk> ' <unk>
However , there is a vague chapter ( for example , ' Spring Dawn Dawn ' is opposed to the chapter 1 of ' Spring Dawn ' in the first section , which is generally accepted ) .
Although it was written in a simple style of writing hiragana ( Japanese syllabary characters ) , in general , there are many short stories in general , and it reflected the misfortune that the downfall of the Nakanokanpaku family and the Empress Teishi 's master Teishi , and some of them were <unk> .
The sophisticated sense of the author and the <unk> of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the tale were fused with the ' Mono no aware ' ( things of the things ) of " The Tale of Genji " ( The Tale of Genji ) , which made the world of ' <unk> ' ( intelligence ) , a sense of beauty .
<unk> evaluation
The Makura no soshi was so deeply loved by humans and nature , and it was used as a wide variety of beauty in each of the ranks ( <unk> ) .
In the following chapters , the following chapters are shown in the form of <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is repeated from the following , and there are no differences in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and they are <unk> ( <unk> ) depending on the expression of <unk> ( <unk> ) .
The expression ' <unk> ' ( Spring Dawn ) is a novel of <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is seen in the Kokin Wakashu ( Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) , which is seen in the ' Spring - Hana - Hana - Hana - <unk> ' ( Spring ) , which is a <unk> of the aesthetic consciousness of readers who were familiar with waka traditional Japanese poetry , and is a <unk> ( <unk> ) .
She showed her respect to chugu Teishi .
It was written in order to avoid Teishi 's soul , who died after Michitaka 's death , when the Michitaka family declined .
Therefore , it is natural that the situation of the decline of the Michitaka family was not written ( same as above , as above , the same as above ) .
Even in the period of despair , the Emperor 's favor and the people who surround chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) and chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) also claimed that they lived in the world of Yoshihisa ( Ueno no ri ) .
Public evaluation
It is a <unk> - like appearance ( <unk> AKIYAMA ) that tried to forget the class from Sei Shonagon to assimilate into the upper reaches of the school .
( This is because the honorific expression does not mean any person who has a high social status than his relatives . )
It was just a ' Record of Civilization in the Inner Palace ' and was not written by the qualification of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ISHIDA ) .
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( also known as Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) was the 15th seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ( his reign was from January 5 , 1866 to January 9 , 1867 ) .
He was the only shogun who did not work as a shogun .
He served as a great vassal of the Imperial Court , and was raised to the First Order of Merit .
He was a member of the House of Peers ( Japan ) .
After Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the 14th Shogun , who had acted as guardian of the shogun , died , he assumed the post of the 15th shogun of the Edo bakufu .
After the Emperor Meiji returned the government to the Emperor , he tried to unite the Imperial Court and the shogunate , but in the Battle of Toba and Fushimi , after the Restoration of Imperial Rule , he returned from Osaka - jo Castle to Edo - jo Castle , leaving the former Shogunate army , and was ordered to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court , and surrendered Edo - jo Castle without any bloodshed .
After he was removed from house arrest in the Meiji period , he immersed himself in hobbies and lived as a prince until the Taisho period .
Yoshinobu ' is also read as ' <unk> ' or ' <unk> ' as his common name .
In the official documents of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , there is a record that ' Yoshihisa ' was read as ' <unk> . '
His name was written in the English language and English newspaper by himself .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , but in Shizuoka City , which spent the rest of his life , he is often called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
According to the person who knew Yoshinobu while he was alive , Yoshinobu himself liked to be called ' <unk> ' and also he also used his name as ' <unk> ' ( a telegraph to his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA ) .
It is said that Yoshinobu succeeded Yoshinobu as the successor of Yoshinobu , and also , like Yoshinobu , he was called ' <unk> ' ( literally , " great man who has been a person who has succeeded the name of a person " ) by people around him .
It is considered that there are two ways of calling ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> ' , and it is quite rare today , but it is now considered that the word ' <unk> san ' can be found in various places not only in Shizuoka but also in any case of these names , and they are often used as ' <unk> ' ( a close - contact expression ) .
Ryotaro SHIBA said that ' people called " <unk> " were in the former retainers 's family line , but it is possible that they were highly respected in the wide area because they could be used even by people related to the Higo Domain who had been engaged in the overthrow of the Shogunate , and were treated favorably .
He was born on September 29 , 1837 as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was the shogun who adopted the lawful wife of his lawful wife , Yoshiko Yoshiko ( the third and third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu was officially considered to be the lawful wife of his father Hidetada , but there is also a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was <unk> .
In accordance with Nariaki 's education policy , ' the boy is brought up in his hometown , ' and he moved to Mito Domain seven months after his birth , and lived there until he inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and was taught about learning and martial arts from <unk> and others .
Yoshinobu 's <unk> seemed to have been attracted by the time , and Nariaki was not adopted by other families , and at first , he thought that he would be able to hand over the hand as a seat of his eldest son Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered him to have <unk> as a successor of the Hitotsubashi family , which was the Hitotsubashi family .
After this , Shichiro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December , he took the name of Yoshinobu from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi often visited Hitotsubashi - tei Residence , and thought Yoshinobu as a leading candidate for the heir of the shogun , but he gave up his decision on the advice of Masahiro ABE , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) .
In 1853 , during the confusion in the arrival of the Black Ships , Ieyoshi died of illness , and Iesada TOKUGAWA , the 13th shogun who succeeded Ieyoshi , had no chance to have a son , and therefore , the problem of ' the heir to the shogun ' was raised ( the heir of the shogun ) .
The Nanki group , including Nariaki , Masahiro ABE , and Nariakira SHIMAZU , the lord of the Satsuma Domain , and Naosuke II , the lord of the Hikone Domain , and Honjuin , who recommended Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA , the real mother of Iesada , opposed Yoshinobu .
The Hitotsubashi - ha attempted to make Nariakira 's adopted daughter Tenshoin as Shogun and Midaidokoro ( shogun 's wife ) , but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another , the Tairo ( chief minister ) Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 , decided to make ' the heir Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA ' and decided to make him ' the heir . '
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States .
Yoshinobu went to the castle with Nariaki , Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of Fukui Domain , and others , and questioned Naosuke , but he was accused of his crime at the castle , and in 1859 , he retired ( Ansei no Taigoku ) .
Yoshinobu himself sent Nariaki a letter that says , ' I would not want to be an heir to the shogun , but I would not have to do anything more than to take over the whole country , ' which is why Yoshinobu himself did not want to take over the country , but I will not take any action .
In 1860 , he was suspended from house arrest .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy Shigetomi OHARA , who was guarded by the Satsuma Domain soldiers led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , entered Edo and ordered him to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as Shogun 's guardian , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga ) to Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On August 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as Shogun 's guardian and Shungaku to the Seiji Sosai ( the president of the political affairs ) .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku implemented the reformation of the shogunate government , called Bunkyu Reforms , and they implemented the <unk> of Kyoto shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) , <unk> of Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as a pioneer of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the shogun , and he worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court , which urged the expulsion of foreigners .
In the prayer of Joi ( expulsion of foreigners ) to Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine , Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine and received a sword from the Emperor , so Iemochi had to carry out Joi ( the principle of excluding foreigners ) , so he called himself ' <unk> ' ( a cold fever ) and made him go to Iemochi .
When the Sonno Joi group centered on the Choshu Domain was expelled from the Choshu Domain in the Coup of August 18 , he returned to Kyoto to participate in the Council of Sanyo ( a political party ) by the Kobu Gattai ( integration of the shogunate and the shogunate ) and Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Shogun ) .
However , as we can not be concluded , they were drunk at drinking parties with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko , and were intentionally drunk , and they were astonished by the party with Munenari DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , who were together , and furthermore , they were <unk> to ' be given by Shimazu , ' and so on , and they also tried to make a good measure to collapse the system .
After that , he stayed in Kyoto and was appointed as the Governor of the Imperial Palace , and was appointed as the Governor of the Imperial Palace , along with Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Aizu Domain ) , the governor of the Aizu Domain , Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Kuwana Domain ) , and the Imperial Court ( the Aizu Domain , Aizu , Kuwana Domain ) , and the Imperial Court , together with the Imperial Court , were responsible for controlling the pro - Imperial loyalists and the court ( the system of the Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA , who supported Yoshinobu , and others , who supported him , <unk> the vassals of the Mito Domain , including Kounsai TAKEDA , and others , who were in support of Yoshinobu , were <unk> .
In 1864 , he commanded the army of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) in the Kinmon Incident and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of the Choshu Domain was finished , he worked hard for the imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States , which had been an imperial sanction , and succeeded in obtaining an Imperial sanction on condition .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an imperial order to conquer Choshu by preventing the Satsuma clan from the Satsuma clan .
However , the Satsuma Domain 's troops , which had formed the Satsuma Alliance , refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma Domain , which was formed by the Satsuma Domain , and the bakufu army was defeated .
On August 20 , during the second conquest of Choshu , Shogun Iemochi died at Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu made a campaign to the Imperial Court and raised an Imperial edict to suspend the fire , and succeeded in concluding a cease - fire agreement .
Although Iemochi recommended Iemochi to succeed the throne , Yoshinobu firmly declined the offer .
On September 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family succeeded to the position of shogun , but the position of shogun was refused .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) and others requested him to become shogun , but they did not accept the acceptance , and on January 5 , they were appointed to shogun by the Imperial proclamation of Emperor Komei .
This was a way to make the shogun as a result of selling gratitude , and he tried to make his political advantage .
Yoshinobu established Yokosuka Iron Factory , Construction and <unk> <unk> ( construction of the Yokosuka Iron Factory ) through the assistance of French minister Léon Léon <unk> , and invited military advisers including Jules Brunet to reform the military system .
Also , he encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study Europe , including sending his younger brother Akitake to Paris Exposition , and encouraged his students to study in Europe .
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port , the Imperial Court insisted on the opening of the port and obtained an imperial sanction .
Yoshinobu , who had been going down to Choshu , reported the Imperial Court to the Emperor on October 14 , 1867 to the throne and received the Imperial sanction ( Taisei Hokan ) .
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time judged that there was no administrative ability and led the feudal lords 's council to continue the Tokugawa government .
However , the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December , and Yoshinobu ordered him to ' Jikan nochi ' ( the Minister of the Interior and the Tokugawa 's territory ) ( dedicated to the Imperial Court ) .
Yoshinobu left the Osaka - jo Castle to avoid a conflict , and gathered foreign ministers and others from foreign countries and claimed to be the legitimacy of Tokugawa , and then , he made the Imperial Court a movement to make the Imperial Court decide on Jikan nochi ( the Imperial Court ) to make a calm form of nochi .
However , in 1868 , the Satsuma Domain raised an army in Edo by provoked the Satsuma Domain to act in Edo , and they blocked Kyoto with the soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana .
However , the former Shogunate army was in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , which broke out on January 3 , and the army of the bakufu was in a disadvantageous situation , and although they still retained enough military strength , they left behind the soldiers and withdrew to Edo with " Gunkan " ( military exploits of the bakufu ) .
Soon after that , the Imperial army led by the Prince Arisugawa no Miya Taruhito started to attack the east , leading Yoshinobu to the Imperial army .
Yoshinobu insisted on allegiance to Yoshinobu , in which he was fighting against the resistance party including Tadaosa OGURI .
In February , he left the situation to Kaishu KATSU and confined himself to the Daiji - in Temple of Ueno Kanei - ji Temple .
The head of the Tokugawa family was transferred to his adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU ( later Iesato TOKUGAWA ) .

Even after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he practiced shuriken ( a shuriken ) in his forehead and was counted as the most famous person among the masters of shuriken .
When his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA had a trouble when he was a successor of the Tokugawa family , he had a <unk> ( a <unk> ) in order to <unk> the <unk> of the Tokugawa family , and when he slept with her husband ( It seems that he was not a mistake , so that he could not suffer a injury , so that he could not be removed when he was sleeping . )
On the other hand , there is an anecdote that when he was coming of age , he went to sleep with three people , as a measure to assassinate him , he was sleeping with two concubines and concubines , as well as one of his wives and concubines .
Although Yoshinobu was said to have been a photograph of his childhood , it is questionable whether he was Yoshinobu himself .
He visited Iemochi 's visit to his illness , and it is said that he usually exchanged it .
Tatewaki AJIMA , the biological father of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , was known for his <unk> and commented on Yoshinobu as ' the Tokugawa family is trying to <unk> the flow of the Tokugawa family ' and when Yoshinobu was <unk> , he was able to take the position of Shogun , and then he was given the dignity of the shogun , and was praised by him until ' the second of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA . '
Hideaki 's Hideaki was also well known for the anti - shogunate faction , and Takayoshi KIDO of Choshu Domain , especially Takayoshi KIDO , who was a member of the Choshu clan , did not have a good relationship with Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI .
Ieyasu was wary of Ieyasu 's coming of life . '
Ryoma SAKAMOTO , who was the decision to return the power of the Emperor to the Emperor , said , " The great shogun ( shogun ) , and the present - day suicide is the same as the present - day act . "
It is also possible that he would be able to agree with the decision .
He praised Yoshinobu as ' I am alive for this public , ' and he tried to give Yoshinobu the position of vice chief chancellor of the new government to him .
However , it was in the Meiji period that Yoshinobu himself knew the existence of Ryoma 's person ( after Ryoma 's death ) .
It was not only Yoshinobu but was known as Ryoma 's reputation during his lifetime , and it was very low than that after the Meiji Restoration .
He lost in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi and ran away to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy 's side by saying ' The enemy 's enemy . '
At this time , the umajirushi of <unk> ( a gold - shaped Japanese horse - shaped flag ) , which had been taken since Ieyasu , forgotten the favorite concubine , but some people <unk> Yoshinobu 's favorite concubine without forget .
However , there is a view that the military uprising needed to resist the armed uprising in Edo and Musashi Provinces , and Yoshinobu became an enemy of the Emperor , and there was a conflict between the territorial lords and other daimyo , and even if he had been able to avoid the intervention of foreign countries , he could not have been able to avoid the war .
On the other hand , it is considered that he was highly regarded as an emperor 's enemy , because he was supposed to have been confined to Kanei - ji Temple , and he was considered to have been a person who valued the Emperor or the Imperial Court ( it is considered that he was from Mito Mitogaku ( the scholarship and academic traditions of Mito ) , which was thought to have been a thought of reverence for the Emperor and the Imperial Court ) , but on the other hand , he did not have a strong influence on the Emperor as his lord , and therefore , he was also said to have a ' weak - kneed ' because he did not have been a bad - minded person who showed his loyalty to the enemy as a enemy .
Due to the fact that the government was transferred to the government due to the bloodless surrender of the Edo Castle and the bloodless surrender of the Edo Castle , the independence of modern Japan was protected and it was highly evaluated that the Meiji Restoration had great achievements .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed as the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family and had a close relationship with him even after the Meiji Restoration .
SHIBUSAWA , who was in the later years of Yoshinobu 's life , tried to compile Yoshinobu 's biography , and persuaded Yoshinobu to persuade him to go to the ' <unk> - kai ' ( <unk> ) .
" <unk> <unk> " ( a book of writing about the secrets of the society ) was compiled .
In some of the chapters of the book , it can be seen that Yoshinobu 's old age was mentioned .
He was asked to ask him for a good reason , and he was asked to tell him about what he wanted , ' Hisamitsu SHIMAZU did n't like Hisamitsu , ' Naomasa NABESHIMA , Naomasa NABESHIMA , ' and showed his feelings and feelings of him .
Based on these materials , " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA 's official introduction " was completed after Yoshinobu 's death .
Yoshinobu left his will to show his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji , who gave the title of duke , who was the highest rank of the nobility , to him , to give him a Shinto funeral instead of a Shinto funeral .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was built not only in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family of the Zojo - ji Temple , the family temple of the Tokugawa family , but also in Yanaka Cemetery , the same round barrow as that of the Imperial Family .
This was because the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was impressed by the fact that the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was simple and modest ( " Tokugawa Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA 's official introduction of Tokugawa Shogunate " ) .
After the pardon , Yoshinobu spent his life in a quiet life without thinking of the former retainers who had dedicated his life to his life , and the roju Katsukiyo ITAKURA , who was then a senior councilor , regretted that ' Yoshinobu and acted with Yoshinobu . '
Although he had a <unk> image of ' escaping ' in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , he was recently concerned with the fact that he tried to establish a new modern political system after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and also also he also made a comeback to the public .
As with his father Nariaki , pork of the Satsuma Domain was favored , and he was called " <unk> Hitotsubashi " ( literally , " <unk> Hitotsubashi " ) , which liked pork .
He also liked Western culture of culture , and he liked his interest in his hobby , such as a picture , a photo , a cane , a bicycle , a cane , a cane , a microscope , and a handicraft ( embroidery ) , and he also learned French from Amane NISHI ( illuminator ) , but it seems that he failed to have been involved in the study of the French language .
Although he was famous as a camera , he seems to have never improved the camera skills .
He often contributed to the photo magazines , but it is said that he did not have been adopted for a long time .
His great - grandson , <unk> TOKUGAWA , was also a free camera and a photograph of the picture that Yoshinobu had been taken over by the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family including the filming of Yoshinobu , was discovered and compiled and edited .
The friends of people living were his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
On January 3 , 1856 , she married Mikako ICHIJO ( after the Meiji Restoration , she changed her name to Mikako ) .
She and <unk> died young on July 16 , 1858 , while her eldest daughter ( <unk> <unk> ) was born .
Since then , she had no children with <unk> and had a son , and all ten sons and 11 daughters born in the Meiji period had a son with two concubines .
The seven sons , <unk> , who became a prince and succeeded the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family , and nine daughters , Keishi , who became the wife of Kaishu KATSU , and others , were adopted by Kaishu KATSU , and the other were the sons of the Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu .
Princess Kikuko , the wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito , and others , were the children of <unk> .
His lawful wife was Mikako ICHIJO ( changed his name to Mikako ) ( from July 19 , 1842 to July 9 , 1894 ) .

The entire line is included in the large urban suburban section .
The formal starting station is Kizu Station , which has a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , but the trains that go from Kyoto to Kizu Station ( odd numbers are ) and the opposite trains ( even even even even in the same case ) are provided .
If specified unless specified is specified , the following routes are taken from Kyoto to Kizu .
The color of the line is brown ( <unk> ) , and the reason for selecting is that ' the image of the classical period , which connects the two ancient capital . '
Jurisdiction ( business type ): West Japan Railway Company ( railway operator )
Railway distance ( operating kilometers ): <unk> km
Track gauge : 1067 mm
Number of stations : 19 ( including the starting and last stations )
Double - tracked section : Shinden - Uji section , JR Fujinomori - Kyoto section
Electrified section : entire line electrified ( DC1500V )
Block system ( railway ) : automatic block system ( double track section ) , single track block system ( single track section )
Safety device : Automatic train stop device
Operation Center : Shin - Osaka General Control Center
Maximum speed : 110 km / h ( double track section ) , 95 km / h ( single track section )
The Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto Branch of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) ( Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company ) .
The line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line , but the entire line is located in Kyoto Prefecture and there is no route in Nara Prefecture .
This was originally constructed by Nara Railway , but was separated from the section of Kizu to the south of Kizu as a part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the merger of the Kansai Railway Company .
However , the trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station in Nara Prefecture , which runs from the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) .
The revision of March 13 , 1988 , the JR West specified the names of the lines ( JR Kyoto Line and JR Kobe Line ) for each line of the Urban Network , but the Nara Line was sent to the Nara Line .
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line also exists on the Kintetsu Corporation , it is sometimes referred to as ' JR Nara Line . '
In the era of Japan National Railways , it was guided by the ' Nara Line of Japan National Railways ' and the English notation of the guide board was also used .
The Kintetsu Nara Line is related to the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is in a rival relationship .
While many trains of the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel with the Keihan Uji Line , the Nara Line did not have the electrification of the railway until 1984 , and even after the electrification , the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 105 cars ran a small number of local trains , including two cars of the JNR Series 105 cars .
However , after the inauguration of JR West , the operation of the train was rapidly improved , including the four - car trains ( six - car trains ) , the double - track section , the operation of the rapid train , the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and the increase of the train - cars .
Currently , the characteristics of this line are strong as sightseeing routes along Uji City , and the line from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture , such as Joyo City .
However , the section between Momoyama and Shinden is a detour , and the section south of Joyo is a section of the section of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , which runs along the central part of the town , and the section of Joyo Station , has a gap between the section and the area .
The trains are used by the Nara Train Yard of the Osaka branch , but the station facilities are managed by the Kyoto branch , except for Kizu Station .
All stations can be used for J - Through , ICOCA , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , and PiTaPa of Surutto KANSAI .
The simplified ticket gates are provided for both unmanned stations in the south of Joyo Station .
Since the Express ' Kuroshio ' ( train ) , which was connected to the Nara Line , Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line in 1984 , was abolished , only local trains were operated ( as a limited express train , special express trains were operated temporarily for a while , so four types of rapid trains and four local trains are currently operated .
The trains are the most rapid type of the Nara Line , and are operated mainly during the daytime .
Basically , trains run at Uji Station with local trains at Uji Station at intervals of 30 minutes .
The nickname ' Miyako <unk> Rapid Service ' was decided by the public to be chosen from the public before the start of the operation .
It is also used by tourists not only by Japanese but also by tourists who connect Kyoto and Nara , which are the tourist spots .
All the trains are operated by the JR West 221 series , and are operated by four cars or six cars .
In the double - track section , the maximum speed of the track is 110 km / h , and other trains are 95 km / h .
The standard time for the train is about 44 minutes from Kyoto , and the route from Nara to Kyoto is 47 minutes .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station for two minutes , and therefore , the trains go down to Nara and go to Nara for Miyakoji Rapid Service , so the trains pass the inbound and outbound trains , and the required time varies slightly depending on the route .
During the three - three days of the new year , the Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari - inari Station .
History
March 3 , 2001 : The operation started .
March 15 , 2003 : The timetable was revised , and the station began to stop at Tofuku - ji Station and Tamamizu Station .
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours .
The trains stop at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) , which pass the ' Miyako Rapid Service . '
The cars are operated with the 221 series , and are operated with four cars or six cars .
Basically , trains run at Uji Station with local trains at Uji Station at intervals of 30 minutes .
Like the above Miyako Rapid Service , Narayama Station , which is operated by rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line , passes through the Yamatoji Line .
The trains that stop at this station until March 2001 when the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' appeared were n't used for the Nara Line , but were used for the 117 electric trains of the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 in Kyoto , Uji , Joyo ( initially passed ) , Kizu and Nara .
Because of the fact that trains run on the Yamatoji Line , there are trains that run through the Yamatoji Line for the trains in the morning and evening .
It is operated mainly in the morning and night .
At first , the timetable was revised on March 18 , 2006 , but it was also operated on Saturdays and holidays .
Although the trains stop at each station , the trains used to run for the direction of Uji Station and the trains to Kizu Station during the late night , and now , the local trains running on the section ran in the direction of the local trains , but now the timetable was changed to the final stop at the same time .
The trains that run from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays use the JNR 103 series Series 103 and all trains that run on the 221 series are operated with the 221 series .
During the morning rush , trains run directly from the Yamatoji Line for the convenience of the operation .
The Nara Line used the same color as the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and the same orange color as the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' to prevent the rapid train from <unk> of the Yamatoji Line , but the timetable revision of March 2008 made the timetable revision , and the timetable revision made the timetable revision , and the timetable revision of the timetable made the timetable , which made the timetable of the regional trains using the rollsign as a green line , and the line of the regional trains became not used as a color .
The timetable on the station side of the station to the north of Kamikoma Station is written with purple letters .
It is operated between Kyoto Station , Uji Station , Joyo Station and Nara Station .
During the daytime , the Kyoto - Joyo section is operated every 15 minutes , but the section between Joyo and Kizu is operated every 30 minutes .
Basically , the cars are operated with 103 series , but they are operated with some 221 series .
Because of the convenience of the operation , there are trains that run directly to the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late evening .
In the past , there were some direct trains with the Sakurai Line , but the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines due to the timetable revision on September 4 , 1994 .
Although this train was a special train , the limited express train was also operated on the Nara Line .
From 1987 to 1988 , the ' Kuroshio ' was used as the nickname of the JNR / JR Limited Express 381 electric train , and the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line , the Hanwa Line , and the Hanwa Line were operated via the Kansai Main Line , and the Hanwa Line .
In the Kinki edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun , which was published on January 6 , 1998 , there was a report that the operation of the limited express train was announced using the Nara Line ( as a regular train ) , but the plan was suspended .
It was once operated as the Miyako Miyako Leisure Line , but the direct trains were n't operated on the Sakurai Line including special trains .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Festival , which is the nearest train to Uji Station , is held , but since the timetable is usually available , it is operated by special timetable from 16 to the last time , and all local trains run between Kyoto and Uji , and after 16 , all local trains run at Kyoto Station and the local trains run at 10 minutes .
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station .
At the time of the first three - month interval , the special timetable was made completely , and the rapid trains stopped at every station between Kyoto and Uji , and the number of trains was increased to increase the number of trains .
Some of the year , the trains that went back to Momoyama Station were set up .
Around 1992 , the direct trains to the Sakurai Line were extended to Tenri Station , mainly on Saturdays and holidays , and one hour were operated .
In addition , special trains are sometimes available from all over Japan .
In particular , during the Tenri <unk> Festival on October 26 , the trains called ' exclusive train for the train bound for the group , ' from Kyoto Station to Tenri Station via the Nara Line , Kizu Station and Nara Line , and the Sakurai Line , run through the Tenri Station .
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot .
JR West Series 221
The Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line are commonly used , and there are two cars , four cars , and six cars .
It is mainly operated by four - car trains and six - car trains , but four - car trains are mainly operated on the Nara Line .
Two - car trains are connected to each other at a holiday timetable .
JNR / JR Commuter Train Series 103
The 103 series 103 cars used for local trains on the Nara Line are operated only by the Nara Line , and they are connected with two cars , and are also operated on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during rush hour .
Some of the cars were transferred from Morinomiya Train Depot on the Osaka Loop Line to the transfer of the cars .
The Nara Railway started operating between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station , but the section between Kyoto Station and Momoyama Station , and the present Kintetsu Kyoto Line , which ran through the route .
On the day of 1921 , when the section between Baba ( current Zeze ) and Kyoto on the Tokaido Main Line was replaced by the current line via Higashiyama Tunnel , the new line between the former Tokaido Main Line and Inari Station and the Fushimi - Momoyama section became the Nara Line , and the section between Kyoto and Fushimi became a freight line .

The section along the National Route 24 between JR - JR - Fujinomori Station and Momoyama Station , and the Keihan Uji Line , which runs between Kohata Station and Uji Station ( near Obaku Station ) , are especially difficult to secure the land for the land .
Because the budget is insufficient , the plan was promoted at least , and the Sagano Line ( the Sanin Main Line , the Sanin Main Line , and Sonobe section ) became a double - tracked line .

Keiji Bypass ( <unk> - <unk> ) is a bypass of general National Highway Road that runs from Kusatsu City , Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama - cho , Kuse County , Kyoto Prefecture .
It was designated as a local standard project .
The Keiji Bypass of the toll road says as follows : The Keiji Bypass of National Highway 1 and the National Highway Route 24 will be described as follows :
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway , and connects with the Otsu City and Kyoto City area , and connects with the Ritto Interchange , Nagoya City , Suita Interchange , and Osaka City area .
The law provided the National Highway 1 - Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange , the <unk> - <unk> - Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange , the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange , the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange - the Kumiyama - Yodo Junction - the Kumiyama - Yodo Junction - the Kumiyama - sen Interchange , the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway No . 478 , and the National Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway Highway II ( general National Highway Road ) , and the Kumiyama - Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange ( Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) , the Kumiyama - wachi Interchange ( Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) , the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange ( the Kumiyama - wachi Expressway ) , the Kumiyama - wachi Interchange ( the Kumiyama - wachi Interchange ) , and Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange ( the Kumiyama - wachi Interchange ) .

The Kyoto Jukan Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway are designated as National Route 478 and have consistently been maintained .
The indication of the route is considered to be Keiji Bypass in the <unk> Junction - Oyamazaki Junction , which is easier to understand by users .
The Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass are not different from the fare and the ETC discount system , even if they pass through the Meishin Expressway .
If otherwise specified , the Keiji Bypass ( from the Seta Interchange to the Oyamazaki Junction ) is designated as a commercial name .

The Uji Tunnel of this route is the longest tunnel among National Route 1 , and the tunnel is forbidden to change the lane except for Uji - higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange 500 meters in front of the Kasatori Interchange .
In the vicinity of Kumiyama Junction , a film " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( The Great <unk> Rainbow Bridge ) was shot before the opening .
The distance of Seta - higashi Interchange - The Oyamazaki Interchange and the Oyamazaki Interchange - Junction is slightly shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and if the Keiji Bypass runs through the Keiji Bypass , the highest speed is faster than the Keiji Bypass , and the destination is located earlier than the Keiji Bypass .
Because the rest space of the service area is not available , the Meishin Expressway is crowded with the Meishin Expressway ( there are two locations of the Otsu Service Area , the Katsura Parking Area ) .
However , the structure was established by the <unk> of Seta - higashi and Oyamazaki Junction ( especially the structure of Oyamazaki Junction became complicated ) , and therefore , the <unk> ( highway ) was reduced to the lower part of the <unk> ( highway ) .
If the Oyamazaki Junction goes to Suita and Osaka , there is a fault that it is sometimes congested with the Meishin Expressway left route .
In addition , since many drivers who want to avoid such curves and slopes are continuously curved , and therefore , they are not fully used as a bypass of Meishin Expressway .
This road is a bypass of National Highway 1 ( National Highway ) , and is a highway dedicated to the expressway , and is not a highway .
If you pass the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka , you must go to the west of the Uji - gawa River .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is half - IC .
Therefore , the traffic of the general road section between the Uji - higashi Interchange and the Uji - nishi Interchange is often congested .
This section of the general road section is not connected to the <unk> , so it is difficult to avoid traffic congestion .

Higashi Hongan - ji Temple is a Buddhist temple of the Jodo Shinshu Sect located in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Shinshu sect ( the ten branch of the Shinshu sect ) , which is the same as the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect ( the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) , which is the Nishi Hongan - ji Temple ( formally called Hongan - ji Temple ) .
The formal temple name was ' Hongan - ji Temple ' until 1987 , and ' Shinshu Honbyo Mausoleum ' after the same year .
It is often called ' <unk> ' ( literally , " east - eastern " ) because it is distinguished from Nishi Hongan - ji Temple located in the same Shimogyo Ward .
( For details of history before the split into two sections , refer to the section of Hongan - ji Temple . )
Kyonyo ( Mitsutoshi ) , the twelfth chief priest of Hongan - ji Temple , was given the temple 's estate on the east side of Hongan - ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , and when Hongan - ji Temple was split into two temples in 1602 , Kyonyo founded Kyonyo .

Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is a god ( humanized god ) appearing in Japanese Mythology .
In " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , the ' Amaterasu ' is called ' <unk> ' when she was enshrined in shrines and other shrines as a natural deity .
It is a god who deified the sun and is considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial Family ( ancestor ) .
In " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is described as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , it is written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
It is also called <unk> no Kami .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , several gods were described , while " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) describes that the name of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' was unified into the shinmei ( name of a god ) .
Although she is a goddess , there is a different theory that she was a male god .
As the shinmei ( name of god ) of Amaterasu Omikami was used in political parts such as " Kotai Kotai Kotai - jingu <unk> " ( the list of Kotai Kotai - jingu Shrine ) , there is a theory that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no Mikoto ) was originally the ancestor of the Imperial Family , and that <unk> became Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
In Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually called Amaterasu Omikami or <unk> Omikami , and when the shrine is enshrined , it is also called Amaterasu Omikami Omikami Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) or Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and when the god is enshrined in the Shinto altar , it is also called Amaterasu Omikami Omikami Omikami .
In academic documents , ' Amaterasu ' and ' <unk> ' are now practiced .
There is a theory that it was written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) in ancient times .
Description in mythology
According to " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , Izanagi returned from the Yominokuni ( the land of the dead ) where Izanami lived , and washed the impurity of the dead , and then she was born when washing her left eye .
At this time , he was called Mihashira no uzuno miko ( three children ) along with Tsukuyomi , who was born from the right eye , and Susano , who was born from his nose .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to govern Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susano , who was entrusted with the ocean , was sent to tears because he wanted to go to Nenokuni ( the underworld ) where Izanami was , and was expelled by Izanagi .
Susanoo went to Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) to meet his older sister Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) before going to Nenokuni , but Amaterasu Omikami thought that his younger brother came to the Plain of High Heaven and waited for him to be armed .
Susano made a pledge to prove Susano 's innocence , and five gods from Amaterasu Omikami 's real objects , Susano 's real divinity , and Susano 's three goddesses were born from the real god of Amaterasu Omikami , Susano 's real god , and Susano declared that Susano would win .
The five gods born from the fact of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and were considered to be the son of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) were the following five gods .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
<unk>
Kumanokusubi
Susano , who was pleased with this , made a violent act in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amaterasu Omikami hid in Ama no iwato ( Cave of heaven ) .
The world became darkness and various misfortunes occurred .
( Eight million gods including <unk> no mikoto ( God of the Chichibu ) and <unk> no mikoto , who were the god of wisdom , succeeded in making Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) from Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and Susano was expelled from Takamanohara ( the Plain of High Heaven ) .
He descended to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( the Central Land of Reed Plains ) to earth his son Amenooshihomimi and sent Amatsu kami ( heavenly god ) .
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni was subdued and Amenooshihomimi finally descended to earth , Ninigi was born and made Ninigi 's grandson Ninigi descended to earth .
Interpretation
In the mythology , it is also seen that Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) prayed to the god of heaven ( Takamimusubi ) who was born earlier than him to make a good judgment on the right and follow him , and therefore , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is considered to be a deified deity of the emperor who ruled the country by performing religious services ( religious services ) .
There is also a view that it was a deified deity of a shrine maiden in ancient times .
The other name ' <unk> ' is ' Hi no onna ' ( a woman of the sun ) , and it means a shrine maiden who serves the sun god .
Although the sun god was originally a male god , there is a theory that a shrine maiden who served the sun god was equated with the sun god and became a goddess .
Also , there is a theory that this goddess was established around the time of Empress Jito , who was the empress , and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami .
The birth of the god of Amaterasu Omikami ( Sun Goddess ) and Tsukuyomi ( Tsukuyomi ) was pointed out to the influence of Dokyo , and the ' <unk> <unk> ' ( Five Sacred Treasures ) in " Reihokan <unk> " ( Five Sacred Treasures ) ( before the sixth century ) , " <unk> " ( The <unk> of the Left ) ( the beginning of the seventh century ) , and " <unk> " ( the <unk> of the 7th century ) , which is a commentary on Taoism , has been pointed out that ' the eyes of the sun and the moon are the sun of the sun and the sun of the sun of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( Sun Goddess ) , Tsukuyomi , and the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun , and the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun , and the sun of the sun , and the sun of the sun of the
It is also said that the concept of the word , such as Okami ( great god ) of Ise - jingu Shrine , jingu Shrine , Saigu ( the Imperial Princess appointed to the Ise - jingu Shrine ) , <unk> ( the Imperial Princess of Ise - jingu Shrine ) , <unk> no Miya ( the purple robe ) , <unk> ( purple clothes ) , <unk> ( light purple ) , <unk> ( light purple ) , <unk> ( light purple ) , <unk> ( light light purple ) , <unk> ( five colors ) , <unk> ( five colors ) , and Toyouke no Okami ( the Toyouke no Okami ) , which enshrine Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and so on , are also combined with Taoism .
In comparison , there is a point that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami and others correspond to the <unk> myth , which has been recorded in the older period ( three to fourth centuries ) .
Since the sun and the sun are the universal <unk> of the whole Asia , some say that it was a myth that spread to Japan along with the people in the prehistoric times .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the divinity changed into three stages .
The following are the following :
645 : Taika Reforms
The Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami before this time .
The sun ' god '
A male god called ' <unk> ' ( literally , " great god " ) was enshrined widely .
" Engishiki " ( codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) contains a shrine that has the name of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) in Tsushima , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) in Harima , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( <unk> ) and ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) in Tanba .
In addition , <unk> is another name for Amenohoakari , a grandson of Amaterasu , and Amenohoakari is also the founder of the Owari clan , Tsumori clan , and Amabe clan .
Also , the younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi and was a great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : Jinshin War .
The name of the shrine is ' <unk> no <unk> ' ( <unk> no <unk> ) , ' <unk> no <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , and ' <unk> no <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In this case , the interpretation that the enshrined deity is the god 's <unk> ( <unk> ) and the interpretation that the god is a male god of <unk> ( <unk> ) .
698 : The shrine was founded .
Amaterasu , ' Amaterasu , ' and ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family . '
She is a goddess .
She was created from nature god to humanized divinity as a model for Empress Jito .
After that , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' other than the Imperial Family was called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( 1060 ) , the part of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' is read as ' <unk> ' and also in ' <unk> ' ( the original text of Amaterasu Omikami ) of " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) , which is written as ' <unk> ' ( the god of Amaterasu Omikami ) .
1880 - 1881 , over the enshrined deity of Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto Jimukyoku ) in Hibiya , Tokyo , a religious dispute arose in the Shinto religion .
The Shinto Jimukyoku decided to enshrine the four deities of the gods of creation ( Ame no Minakanushi no Kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Kamimusubi no kami ) and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) as the enshrined deity in the shrine of the clerical bureau , but ' Izumo school ' insisted that the enshrined deity of the Izumo school should be enshrined in the five deities ( the same as the other world ) , and the god of the divine world ( the world ) should be placed in the five deities ( the other world ) .
However , the ' Ise school ' , which was in charge of the center of the Shinto Jimukyoku , was ' the supreme leader of the world ' that Amaterasu Omikami ruled Ryokai Ryokai ( the Ryokai - Ryokai ) , and other gods opposed the two groups , including the other gods , which insisted that they were too loyal to the emperor .
After that , various rumors were heard , such as ' Izumo school has been <unk> for a long time since the gods of gods , ' ' ' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ' ( <unk> ) and ' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
The dispute was eventually settled by the decision of Emperor Meiji , and the divinity of Amaterasu Omikami was ranked at the highest rank .
It is said that the government acknowledged the possibility of creation of the creed system common to Shinto , and that the modern state was not able to control the people directly through the restoration Shinto teachings .
Refer to the dispute on the enshrined deity of State Shinto Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto Jimukyoku ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA used the other name ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) in his own novel to appear in the novel , when he wrote Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
This is because the name ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) meant to appear in the following sentences , so the sun god and the god were also the character of nature , and the word ' <unk> ' was used .
In fact , there are many novels of Akutagawa that were not able to correct , corrections , corrections , and corrections by the army , and to be deleted .
<unk> YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who founded <unk> Gakuin ( <unk> ) , established the <unk> School in 1926 , said ' Japan has faith in Amaterasu Omikami .
Amaterasu Omikami is an ideal to <unk> the world by making Japanese spirit .
The ideal of Izanami and Izanagi is that ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) is <unk> , in other words , as well as the idea of the pioneer of the world , the pioneer , and the leader of the world . '
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami are called Shinmei - jinja Shrine , and all over the country are the main shrine ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) of the Ise - jingu Shrine .
The Kotai - jingu Shrine is a Shinto shrine that enshrines one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family , Yata no Kagami ( the eight sacred mirror ) , which is one of the sacred objects .
Most shrines throughout Japan sell talismans ( taima ) of Kotai - jingu Shrine ( Amaterasu Omikami Kotai - jingu Shrine ) .
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) was a term derived from a large - scale myoshu .
It is greatly referred to as a person who has a name .
Shomyo was the last to become a Buddhist priest .
He said that he had a strong power in the region .
In the samurai society , the word came to mean a samurai who owned many territories and subordinates .
In the Muromachi period , shugo strengthened their control over their territories , and became Shugo daimyo ( provincial military governor ) .
In the Sengoku period , a powerful feudal lord who established a strong control of his own territory appeared and was called a kokujin ( local samurai ) or Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period ) .
In the Edo period , the term came to mean samurai families that were given more than 10,000 koku ( approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield ) by the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
Among the samurai who were less than 10,000 koku , samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called direct retainers .
Daimyo were called daimyo ( feudal lord ) because they shared the character of feudal lords and the character of the feudal lord in China , and they were called daimyo ( feudal lords ) .
This section describes the details of the early - modern daimyo in the Edo period .
For the details of Shugo daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) and Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) , refer to the article for the details .
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) in the Edo period
Daimyo in the Edo period were determined by the social standing , official ranks , ranks , and shikoseki .
First , the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family was divided into the families of the Tokugawa family ( shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , Shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , Shinpan ( relatives of the Tokugawa family ) , fudai daimyo ( hereditary vassal ) , which had been a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara , and Tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) who had been a vassal of the Tokugawa family .
When the shogun Ieyasu died out , he maintained the kechimyaku ( lineage of blood ) , surveillance of the shogun 's control , and assisted the bakufu to support the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was permitted to use the Tokugawa family , and in the same sense , he appointed the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA , the 10th son of Kishu Domain , Yorinobu TOKUGAWA , and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA , the eleventh son of Kishu Domain , and the eleventh son of Yorifusa TOKUGAWA , to Mito Domain .
Furthermore , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of Ieyasu and the second son of Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to Echizen Domain , and established a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) of the Tokugawa family throughout the country .
Furthermore , he placed hereditary vassals who built the foundation of the Tokugawa Shogun family as fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu , and also , in order to secure the bakufu 's military power , he was appointed to important positions , mainly by roju ( senior councilor ) of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and made him decide to make the shogunate government the advice of the shogunate government .
Fudai daimyo were relatively low , and the clans of the Torii clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , the Honda clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Ogasawara clan , and the Ogasawara clan gained relatively <unk> , but the fudai daimyo who maintained 100,000 koku ( approximately <unk> million liters of crop yield ) of the Abe clan , the Hotta clan , the Hotta clan , the Yanagisawa clan , and the Toda clan were only the only one .
This led to the separation of power and military power .
After the Battle of Sekigahara , tozama daimyo were subordinated to the Tokugawa family , and many families were opposed to the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara .
The bakufu was so cautious that the bakufu was very cautious that they actively carried out intelligence activities by spies and feared illegal activities and rebellion , and strictly punished them by being deprived of their fief .
The major daimyo of the domains of the Kaga Domain , the Kaga Domain of the Maeda clan , the Sendai Domain , the Sendai Domain , the Sendai Domain , the Kuroda clan , the Fukuoka Domain , the Hiroshima Domain , the Mori clan , the Choshu clan , the Yonezawa Domain , the Yonezawa Domain , the Saga - Uesugi clan , the Nabeshima clan , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Satake clan , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Satake clan , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain
In addition , when daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) had to have a territory equivalent to a province or a person with a castle was distinguished from a daimyo , a daimyo ( feudal lord ) who had a castle with a lord ( joshukaku ) or a castle with a castle , and jinya ( a regional government office ) , and a daimyo ( feudal lord ) who had no castle was not allowed to reside in a castle was appointed to Edo - jo Castle , and was treated as a room .
For more information , refer to the section of shikoseki .
Although the level of daimyo was not limited to the level of <unk> daimyo , the daimyo with 100,000 koku were not allowed to possess the entire territory of soil , and most of them had territories around the castle town and a place .
In extreme cases , one village was divided into another feudal lord ( <unk> ) .
Although daimyo were generally more than 10,000 koku , the Kitsuregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was 5,000 koku of the Kitsuregawa clan .
This is because the Kitsuregawa clan was descended from the Ashikaga clan .
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of Buke Shohatto ( Laws for the Military Houses ) and Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In addition , the bakufu was ordered to defend the seashore in assignments called <unk> and at the end of the Edo period , and daimyo always had financial difficulties .
