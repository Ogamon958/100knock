Generally , it is called Dogen Zenji .
It is said that he spread the manners and cleaning manners and the manners of eating meals in Japan .
There is also a theory that he first brought back <unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) .
Although there are many questions about Dogen 's birth , there are various theories on the fact that he was born in the direct line of Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO ( MINAMOTO no Michichika and Michichika KOGA ) , who was Naidaijin ( Minister of the Interior ) .
According to the established theory , he was born as a son of Michichika and FUJIWARA no Ishi , a daughter of FUJIWARA no Motofusa ( Motofusa ) MATSUDONO , who was the daughter of Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) Motofusa MATSUDONO ( FUJIWARA no Motofusa ) , but in recent years , the theory has become widely accepted that he was the biological child of Michitomo HORIKAWA , who was considered to be his foster father .
There is also a theory that Michichika 's son MINAMOTO no Michimune , MINAMOTO no Michimune , and Michiteru KOGA were his father .
According to his biography " <unk> , " he lost his father ( Michichika ) at the age of three , lost his mother at the age of eight , and was adopted by his older paternal half - brother , Michitomo HORIKAWA .
According to one theory , after the death of his parents , he wanted to adopt his maternal uncle Moroie MATSUDONO ( former Regent and Minister of the Center ) , who was his maternal uncle , as an adopted heir of the Matsudono family , but it is also said that Dogen , who felt the impermanence of the world , declined .
There is a theory that Shinran , the founder of Jodo Shinshu ( the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) , met each other with his maternal relatives , but it is not confirmed .
There is a theory that the volume of " Shobogenzo " ( Treasury of True Teaching ) written by Shinran was written for Shinran .
In 1213 , he visited his maternal uncle <unk> , who was on the side of Mt. Hiei .
In 1214 , he entered the priesthood with <unk> , the Tendai - zasu ( head priest of the Tendai sect ) , and took the name of Dogen .
In 1215 , he studied the Tendai sect under <unk> of Onjo - ji Temple .
He studied under Myozen , a disciple of Eisai at Kennin - ji Temple in 1217 .
In 1223 , along with Myozen , he went over Mt. Mimoro from Hakata to the Southern Sung Dynasty and received Inka ( Certification of spiritual achievement ) from Nyojo Tendo of the Soto sect .
In 1228 , he returned to Japan .
He founded Kosho - ji Temple in Fukakusa , Kyoto in 1233 .
At that time , he was oppressed by Mt. Hiei .
In July 1243 , he was invited by Yoshishige HATANO , jito ( manager and lord of manor ) of Echizen Province , and moved to Echizen <unk> no sho .
On the way , in response to the invitation of Nobutsuna SASAKI , the feudal lord of Kutsuki - mura village , Kutsuki - mura , he stood at Kutsuki - mura village ( the origin of Kosho - ji Temple ( Takashima City ) ) .
He founded Osaragi - ji Temple in Kasamatsu in 1244 .
In 1246 , he changed the name of Osaragi - ji Temple to Eihei - ji Temple and changed his pen name to <unk> .
At this time , he went down to Kamakura to invite the regent Tokiyori HOJO , Yoshishige HATANO and others .
The period of edification in Kamakura lasted for half a year , but it became the beginning of pure Zen in the Kanto region .
In 1253 , he handed over Eihei - ji Temple to his disciple Koun Ejo , and died at the residence of his disciple <unk> <unk> ( Takatsuji - dori Street , Kyoto City ) , and at the age of 54 ( 53 years old ) .
It is said that the cause of his death was <unk> .
Even if it was completed at a certain level , it was not to attain Buddhahood , and even if it would become a Buddha , it was the essence of Buddhahood ( <unk> ) , which was the essence of Buddhahood ( <unk> ) , followed by Shaka , and insisted that it was the supreme practice of mediation ( <unk> ) .
Many of the Kamakura Buddhism agreed on the Mappo - shiso ( the end of the Dharma ) , but according to " Shobogenzo " ( Treasury of True Teaching ) , it is now called " <unk> " and " Shobogenzo " ( Treasury of True Teaching ) , " this word is not true .
It is a hoben ( expedient ) for a long time to stand Shozo <unk> ( <unk> ) in Buddhism .

Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum , located in <unk> - cho , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture , is a storage facility for steam locomotives managed by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) .
On October 10 , 1972 , it was founded by Japan National Railways for commemorating the 100th anniversary of the opening of Japan National Railways ( JNR ) in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , using a fan - shaped facility in Umekoji Ward , Kyoto City , and in the first century , it was the first Japanese facility to have steam locomotives , which had been supported by Japanese railway transportation , as an important cultural property , and to preserve it .
With the division and privatization of Japan National Railways in 1987 , JR West succeeded it .
In addition , this facility is a regular train yard ( Umekoji Ward ) , and it is also conducted by the JNR <unk> diesel locomotives owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway and the JNR <unk> diesel locomotives .
In the first place , this facility came to be established as a result of the fact that it rapidly disappeared from the latter half of the 1960s to preserve steam locomotives .
At first , Oyama Ward , which was located on the premises of Koyama Station in Tochigi Prefecture , was the most likely candidate for the preservation of the body , but as it was located in ' the central part of Japan , ' Umekoji Ward ( at that time ) was officially selected as a preservation body in 1970 .
The purpose of storage cars was to be selected as the oldest car ( if possible ) existing in principle , but there were also some cars that were supposed to be preserved at first like C62 Type 2 .
The facilities were derived from " Steam Locomotive Exhibition " ( Steam Locomotive Museum ) , which utilized <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) of the former Umekoji Engine Depot , and " Materials Museum " , which was relocated and restored the former Nijo Station building .
The <unk> was made of a reinforced concrete structure constructed in 1914 , and was designated as an Important Cultural Property along with the line .
In the same year , 2004 , it was dedicated to the civil engineering site for the study of Kokkagakkai .
In 2006 , the former Nijo Station building ( exhibition hall ) , a model - shaped steam locomotive and a set of tools , which had been preserved by JR West , were designated as quasi - railway monuments .
The former Nijo station building was constructed in 1904 by imitating Heian - jingu Shrine in consideration of its scenery , although it was the oldest wooden building that was constructed by the Kyoto Railway Company as its headquarters .
The Kyoto Railway was nationalized in 1907 , and later it was used as a station building for JR West , but in 1996 , it ended up its role as a station building when the Sanin Main Line ( Sagano Line ) and Hanazono Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) were elevated , and in 1997 , it was moved to the main building , reconstructed and reconstructed as the entrance hall , and used the old ticket room as a museum .
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996 .
In the fan - shaped magazine , the 16 - car steam locomotive manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period , which was produced by the Taisho period , eighteen - car steam locomotives ( 16 - car locomotives at the beginning of the museum ) were displayed and exhibits .
At the beginning of the opening , it was generally preserved in a dynamic state , and there were two cars of Type <unk> and <unk> No . 51 , but after that , it had been handed down to 15 cars , and later , in 2006 , the object of storage was reviewed several times , and the preservation machine has become 7 - 7 - ryo .
Among the five cars , five cars are currently registered , and two cars ( C57 <unk> , 56 <unk> ) are served on the main line of the Yamaguchi Line , such as ' Yamaguchi ( train ) ' ( train ) and ' Kita Biwako ' ( train ) on the Hokuriku Main Line .
Although there is a registration machine other than these two locomotives , it is impossible to run on the main line because it is not fully inspected .
In addition , the ' SL Steam Locomotive No . <unk> ' ( SL Steam Locomotive No . <unk> ) is operated on the railway of the museum by the steam of the exhibition machine .
This display route used to be located at the north end of a large - sized car parking lot ( a rest facility and a park once stood on the premises ) , but it was moved to the north of the former Nijo Station station building , along with the relocation of the former Nijo Station building building building building , and it was changed to a side side of the Sagano Line by side .
Even now , it has a function as an organization , and is also connected to the operating line .
After the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company was closed , it was also maintained by steam locomotives .
Plum trees
The name comes from ' Ume ' meaning Umekoji .
Except for the C62 C62 Type No . <unk> , which had been designated in 1976 , all of them were designated as quasi - quasi - quasi - railway monuments along with the number of cars and the <unk> of conservative tools in 2006 .
The procedure to be transferred from the former affiliated organization in 1972 is taken from the former organization organization .
" <unk> " has been preserved in Umekoji since it has been preserved .

Shomyo is one of the Japanese traditional music .
It is a religious music used for rituals in Buddhist scriptures and Buddhist scriptures and is used for rituals .
In Japan , it is also called <unk> or <unk> .
It is written as <unk> in old Chinese characters .
It is one of the fields of ancient India .
The term " Shomyo " refers to five fields of learning : Shomyo ( phonology , grammar , and grammar ) , <unk> ( science ) , <unk> ( science ) , Inmyo ( learning ) , Inmyo ( learning ) ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , <unk> ( ethics ) , and <unk> ( ethics ( ethics ) , and Buddhist scholars ) .
It was established along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan .
In 754 , a Buddhist memorial service was held at the time of the ceremony to consecrate the Great Buddha of Todai - ji Temple , and it is believed that Shomyo was actively practiced in the Nara period .
In the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai handed down the Buddhist Shomyo and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and the Shingon Shomyo .
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect also have their own Buddhist Shomyo , which is still passed down .
Since Shomyo ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) was handed down by <unk> , there were no scores .
Therefore , the teaching of the school was extremely difficult .
Later , <unk> , which was a musical score , was invented .
In addition , depending on each school , there are differences in terms of professional terms such as hakase .
However , the meaning of hakase is a reference for chanting , and it is necessary to learn the chanting of Buddhist hymns ( also called <unk> ) , and it is necessary to maintain and inherit the school from the teacher to his disciples .
Therefore , it was essential for the training of instructors and successors .
With various conditions , many schools were abolished .
The Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) was passed down by Saicho , which led to the foundation of Saicho 's own development .
After Saicho , Ennin and <unk> became prosperous .
Ryonin , the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu , is known as the restorer of the temple .
In 1109 , Ryonin built Raigo - in Temple ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) in Ohara , Kyoto .
Its sango ( literally , " mountain name " ) , which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple , was written as " <unk> " ( literally , " mountain name " ) , and it was called " <unk> " ( literally , " mountain name " ) .
Later , two temples of Raigo - in Temple and Shorin - in Temple came to be known as the training hall of Ohara School Shomyo Shomyo .
In addition , <unk> HARA founded a school , and in Ohara there was a statement of the two schools .
Later , <unk> restored Ohara Shomyo .
It was founded by Tankai to establish a flow based on the new music theory .
After that , he did not have the center of the Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) and was handed down to the present Tendai Shomyo ( Buddhist liturgical chant ) .
The Yuzu Nenbutsu sect , Jodo sect , and Jodo Shinshu Shomyo ( chanting of the Buddhist chant ) are of the Tendai Shomyo .
The mantra chanting of the Shingon sect is based on Kukai 's handwriting , which has been passed down to the present day .
It was after Shinga that the chanting of Buddhist hymns had been systematized .
It can be said that Kancho was the restorer of the temple .
He worked for the music and maintenance of Shomyo ( Buddhist hymns ) .
Until the Kamakura period , there were many schools , but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakuho by four schools ( Hon - ryu , Shin - ryu , Daigo - ryu , Daigo - ryu , and Nakagawa Daishin - ryu ) .
The reading of Kogi Shingon Sect declined and disappeared from the Edo period .
The <unk> - ryu , Shin - in , Daigo - ryu and Daigo - ryu were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period .
Currently , it is divided into <unk> Shomyo ( Chishaku - in Temple in Kyoto ) , <unk> Shomyo ( chanting of Buddhist hymns ) ( Hase - dera Temple in Nara ) , <unk> ( Mt. Koya , Kogi Shingon sect ) .
The names of Chisan Shomyo , Buzan Shomyo ( Shingi Shingon sect ) , Shingon sect Buzan school , Buzan school , Buzan school , Shingon sect Buzan school , and both of which were originally derived from the Nakagawa Taijo School .
Raiyu adopted the school of Daigo .
In 1583 , when Negoro - ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and fell into decline , the two schools of Chisan and Buzan came to form a group based on the old school of Daigo .
Its characteristics are the ' debate ' of Buzan 's Buzan school ' and ' Shomyo ' ( Shomyo ) .
The <unk> School ( Kogi Shingon sect ( Kogi Shingon sect ) ) , which was based on the Nakagawa <unk> School .
The Nakagawa Daishin - ryu school was founded by <unk> of Nakagawa - ji Temple in Nara .
In the Joei era ( 1232 - 1233 ) , <unk> of Mt. Koya and Sanbo - in Temple moved their base to Mt. Koya .
Later , he changed his name to Nanzan - san Mountain , which was another name for Mt. Koya , and was named Nanzan - san .
It is also referred to as the <unk> School and the <unk> School .
It can be said that the music of Heikyoku , Yokyoku , folk song , Joruri ( dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment ) , Joruri ( dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment ) , etc . were transformed into Shomyo .
It was greatly influenced by the melody melody .

He established the gengo ( era name ) called Taika and implemented various reforms ( the Incident of Isshi [ the Murder in the Year of Isshi ] ) .
He also caused a coup d'etat such as Arima no Arima no Miko ( Prince Arima ) and tried to be sentenced to death by setting a trap .
Because Baekje was destroyed by Tang Dynasty China and Silla in 660 , Buyeo Pung , a prince of Baekje , who was staying in the Imperial Court , returned to Baekje and tried to restore Baekje .

Emperor Tenchi ( February 20 , 668 ) - ascended the throne .
He died on January 7 , 672 at the age of 46 .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief Brief History of Japan ) , it is said that after the death of Emperor Tenmu , the Emperor died of illness , he was killed by the Emperor <unk> Yamashina no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The reason why Emperor Tenchi did not ascend the throne for a long time was one of the mystery in the history of politics in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories regarding this .
It was in consideration of Emperor Tenmu 's power that recommended Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , it is wrong that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is based on the theory that Emperor Kogyoku gave birth to Emperor Jomei before he married Emperor Jomei , and that he was the maternal half - brother of Emperor Tenchi .
In fact , if calculating the year of birth based on the year of Emperor Tenmu 's death in some history books of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , Emperor Tenmu became older .
However , there are no contradictions between the same historical materials , and there are many historical materials that have the age of 8 to 9 .
On the other hand , there is an opinion that " although the father is different from the father , the younger brother will be sent to his older brother , " therefore , he intentionally claimed that the age of Tenchi was too bad , but the age of Emperor Tenchi at the age of 16 is described in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the age of Emperor Jomei , who was the father of Emperor Jomei , died at the age of 16 .
Therefore , the real year of birth was 614 , which was adopted by Honcho koin jounroku ( the Emperor 's family tree ) and so on .
In ancient times , there was no possibility that " In ancient times , " and Emperor Tenchi and Jito , who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu , did not immediately succeed to the throne .
It was because of the error .
There is also a different opinion that it is not the same because it is pointed out that the theory of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) and the other historical books were compiled as " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age . ' )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat by Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and it is said that Naka no Oe no Oji was driven out of power .
Recently , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good , and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to that of the Prince Naka no Oe .
In this way , Prince Naka no Oe no Oji did not have a motive to kill Iruka .
In addition , the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) has been <unk> , so this theory came to be advocated .
In this theory , the Soga clan other than Iruka had not been expelled for the reasons of the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka was not purged even after a coup , and therefore , it attracted attention to other questions .
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to the opposition from the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi .
This suggests that Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , pointed out the relationship between her wife Hashihito no Himemiko ( younger maternal half - sister of Emperor Tenchi ) and Emperor Tenchi .
Although his love and marriage between her paternal half - brother and sisters were allowed to be allowed , it was interpreted that she was not allowed to have a love relationship between her maternal half - sister and her maternal half - sister , but in the case of a rainbow in the sky of <unk> <unk> , she was persuaded by her uncle Karu no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and she was surprised to see Arima no miko and so on .
After the death of Empress Saimei , Hashihito no Himemiko succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the empress of the previous emperor , but there is a theory that the records were deleted for some reason .
This is based on the " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) that says that ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' came from Hashihito no Himemiko , and ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' can be interpreted as the interim emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .
If Hashihito no Himemiko is referred to as ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto ' , there is a theory that it was necessary for her to be referred to as ' Nakatsusumera - mikoto , ' but there is also a theory that she was Empress Saimei , so it is not necessarily confirmed .
It is difficult to prove it because of the nature of political history and the restrictions of historical materials , however , the development of research in future including cooperation with archaeological results , etc .
Poems
He was also a poet of the Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) .
" Ogura Hyakunin Isshu " ( the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka - poems by One Hundred Poets ) contains respect for Taiso ( the founder ) of the Heian dynasty , and the following poem is included at the beginning .

It is also one of the following poems from the Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) .
The hill of Mt. Unebi is very fond of Mt. Unebi , and if Mt. Miminashi and Miminashi have come from the age of the gods , it looks like a little <unk> .
The Saionji family was a court noble who was descended from the Fujiwara clan .
The family was descended from the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan , and its social standing was the Seiga family .
The Toin family and the Imadegawa family ( Kikutei family ) were separated from the Saionji family .
The Saionji clan , a samurai family in Iyo Province , was also a powerful branch of the Saionji family who used the family name of Saionji .
Its kamon ( family crest ) is Hidari mitsudomoe ( three comma - shaped figures ) .
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Suemichi , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane .
At the time of Kintsune SAIONJI , the great - grandson of Michisue , he married MINAMOTO no Yoritomo 's niece as his wife during the Jokyu War and was confined to the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and after the Jokyu War , he gained the trust of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and gained the real power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi ( liaison officer in the Kanto region ) and was raised to Daijo - daijin ( Grand minister of state ) .
The family name of Saion - ji Temple derives from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his second residence in Kyoto ( Kitayama no sho , Kadono County , Yamashiro Province ) .
This hall was also called Kitayama - dono , and the present Kinkaku - ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA over this land .
He received the support of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) from Kintsune , and gained power over the Sekke ( line of regents and advisers ) through the Kamakura period .
Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) and gave his daughter to Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo .
However , after the death of his son , Kinhira SAIONJI , the Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) came from the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , supporting the Jimyoin - to ( imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu ) and deepened the conflict with Daikakuji - to ( imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama ) .
Later , in the era of Kinmune SAIONJI , the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) fell and was dismissed from Kanto moshitsugi .
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO ( Tokioki ) , who was the remnants of the Hojo clan , and plotted to assassinate Emperor Godaigo , who started the Kenmu Restoration , to enthrone the Retired Emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin - to ( imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu ) , and the plot was revealed by the betrayal of his younger brother , Kinshige SAIONJI , and was executed .
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Sanetoshi SAIONJI , the son of Kinmune SAIONJI , served the Northern Court ( Japan ) and became Udaijin ( Minister of the Right ) and restored the family name .
In the Muromachi period and the Edo period , it was also known as a family which specialized in biwa ( Japanese lute ) .
In the early Edo period , Saneharu SAIONJI invited Tadataka HOSOKAWA , the heir of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA ( later disinherited ) and Tokuhime , the eldest daughter of Kyumu NAGAOKA , to serve as Midaidokoro ( a wife of a shogun ) , but Nagaoka Kyumu NAGAOKA received various funds from the Saionji family and donated 600 stones to the Saionji family ( <unk> ) .
At the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from the Tokudaiji family of the same Kanin line , and after the Meiji Restoration , he was active as a politician and served as Prime Minister , and played an important role in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods .
Incidentally , Kinmochi did not like playing biwa ( Japanese lute ) , which was supposed to be the family business of the Saionji family , but during his prime minister 's service , he was said to have wished to listen to the biwa ( Japanese lute ) of the Saionji family for a long time , and there is an anecdote that he was forced to play together with the staff of gagaku ( ancient Japanese court dance and music ) of the Imperial Household Ministry of the Imperial Household .

According to the postscript , it was established around 996 , when Sachujo ( Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards ) MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa brought it from the house of the author and spread to the public .
After that , the book was revised and it is considered that it was written around the end of the year of the Kanko era .
The text of " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) , which was drawn in " Genji Monogatari Shimeisho " ( The Tale of Genji ) by Genji Monogatari ( The Tale of Genji ) , does not exist in the text of " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) , and it seems to have a complicated process .

Since the Noin version was used as the original text for old movable editions ( Kanei era ) in the early Edo period , it became a set of commentaries such as " Makura no soshi <unk> " ( The Pillow Book ) , " Makura no Soshi <unk> " ( The Pillow Book ) and " Makura no Soshi <unk> " ( Commentary on Kigin KITAMURA ) , which became a commentary on " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) and " Makura no Soshi <unk> " ( The Pillow Book ) .
However , after the World War II , Jutaro TANAKA ( 1917 - 1987 ) re - evaluated the second edition of the third volume , and after the Second World War , it was exclusively published and was read as a textbook .

On the other hand , there is a vague chapter of classification ( for example , the first section of ' Spring Dawn ' has been opposed to <unk> chapters ) .
It is written in a simple colloquial style that uses hiragana ( Japanese syllabary characters ) , but in general , there are many short stories in general , and in contrast to the downfall of the Nakanokanpaku family and the misfortune of his lord Teishi , there is also a feeling of <unk> .
While the sophisticated sense of beauty of the author , and the sharp observation eyes of the object of the " Genji Monogatari " ( The Tale of Genji ) were integrated into the " Genji Monogatari " ( The Tale of Genji ) , the expression of " Mono no aware " ( the pathos of things ) , which was expressed in the feelings of " Genji Monogatari " ( The Tale of Genji ) , developed the world of beauty of " <unk> no aware " ( the beauty of an intelligence ) .
<unk> evaluation
The " Makura no soshi " ( The Pillow Book ) loved human beings and nature , so that they were given a wide range of beauty and formed as a wide variety of beauty ( <unk> ) .
Depending on the <unk> of the following chapters , there is no distinction between <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) , depending on the expression of <unk> ( <unk> ) .
The expression of ' <unk> ' ( the season ) is a novel written in the ' Haru - Hana - Hana - hana ' ( Spring ) , which is seen in the Kokin Wakashu ( Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) at that time , in which the expression ' <unk> ' ( literally , ' Spring and Autumn ' ) , which is seen in the Kokin Wakashu ( Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) , followed by the <unk> of the readers who were accustomed to the traditional Japanese poetry .
She showed great respect to chugu Teishi .
It was written in order to console Teishi 's soul , who died after the death of Teishi , when the Michitaka family declined .
Therefore , it is natural to say that the decline of the Michitaka family was not written ( same as the above - mentioned above ) .
Even in the period of despair , even though people who surround chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) and chugu ( the second consort of an emperor ) were in despair , they also claimed that they lived in the world of Yoshihisa ( Ueno no ri [ law of Kozuke Province ] ) .
Public evaluation
It appears in <unk> ( <unk> AKIYAMA ) who tried to forget the class from Sei Shonagon to assimilate into the upper reaches of the school .
( This is because there is no honorific expression for those who have high social status than their relatives . )
It was just ' the record of the civilization of the empress 's residence ' and was not written by the qualification of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ISHIDA ) .
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( also known as Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) was the 15th seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ( his reign was from January 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 ) .
He was the only shogun who did not work as Shogun in Edo - jo Castle .
He was awarded the rank of Junior First Rank , First Order of Merit .
He was a member of the House of Peers .
He became the 15th shogun of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) after the death of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the 14th shogun who had acted as a guardian of the shogun .
After the Emperor Meiji returned to power ( Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he aimed at Kobu - gattai ( integration of the imperial court and the shogunate ) , but in the Battle of Toba and Fushimi after the Restoration of Imperial Rule , he returned from Osaka - jo Castle to Edo - jo Castle , leaving the former Shogunate army , and received an order to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court , and surrendered Edo - jo Castle .
After he was removed from house arrest in the Meiji period , he devoted himself to hobbies and lived as a prince until the Taisho period .
Yoshinobu ' is also read as ' <unk> ' or ' <unk> ' as his common name .
In the official documents of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , there is a record that " <unk> " was read as " <unk> . "
His name was written as ' <unk> ' in the English language and English newspaper by himself .
In Mito City , where he was born , he is often called ' <unk> , ' but in Shizuoka City , where he spent the rest of his life , he is often called ' <unk> . '
According to the person who knew Yoshinobu while he was alive , Yoshinobu himself liked to be called ' <unk> sama ' and he also used his name as ' <unk> ' to his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA .
It is said that <unk> TOKUGAWA , who succeeded Yoshinobu after Yoshinobu , was also called ' <unk> ' by people around him as Yoshinobu .
It is considered that there are two ways of calling them ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> san ' ( <unk> ) , and it can be seen nowadays , but it can be confirmed not only in Shizuoka but also in various places , and it is often used to refer to " <unk> " ( <unk> ) in both cases .
Ryotaro SHIBA said that ' many people called " <unk> " were related to former retainers of the shogun , but it is possible that he was highly respected in a wide range of areas because of the fact that the use of people related to the Higo Domain , who worked for the overthrow of the Shogunate , could be confirmed . '
On September 29 , 1837 , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was the shogun who gave birth to his lawful wife , Princess Yoshiko ( the third Shogun , Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) .
However , Iemitsu 's real mother is considered to be the lawful wife of his father Hidetada , but there is also a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother .
His childhood name was <unk> .
He moved to the Mito Domain seven months after Nariaki 's education policy called ' raising his son in his hometown , ' and lived there until he inherited the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and was taught about learning and martial arts from <unk> and others .
Yoshinobu 's <unk> seemed to have received attention from those days , so Nariaki was not adopted by other families , and at first , he thought that he would be <unk> to his eldest son ( eldest son ) Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA as a hikae .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ordered him to appoint <unk> to Mito Domain as a successor of the Hitotsubashi family .
After this , Shichiro succeeded to the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December , he took the name of Yoshinobu from Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA , the 12th shogun .
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi - tei residence , so he thought Yoshinobu as a leading candidate for the heir of the shogun , but he gave up the offer of roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) Masahiro ABE .
In 1853 , the shogun Ieyoshi died of illness in the midst of the disorder of the arrival of the Black Ships , and Iesada TOKUGAWA , the 13th shogun , who succeeded Ieyoshi , had no chance to have a son and had a son , therefore , there was a problem that ' the heir to the shogun ' ( the heir of the shogun ) was born ( the issue of the heir ) .
The Hitotsubashi group , including Nariaki , Masahiro ABE , and Nariakira SHIMAZU , the lord of the Satsuma Domain , and Naosuke II , the lord of the Hikone Domain , who recommended Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA , the lord of the Kishu Domain , and Honjuin , the real mother of Iesada , opposed the Nanki group .
The Hitotsubashi group tried to make Tenshoin , the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , to become Shogun and Midaidokoro ( shogun 's wife ) , but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another and the Tairo ( chief minister ) Naosuke II , who became the Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 , decided to ' Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA . '
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States .
Yoshinobu went to the castle with Nariaki , Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , the lord of Fukui Domain , and others and questioned Naosuke , but on the contrary , he was accused of the crime of visiting the castle , and in 1859 , he retired ( Ansei no Taigoku [ suppression of extremists by the Shogunate ] ) .
On the other hand , Yoshinobu himself sent Nariaki a letter to Nariaki that says , ' I do not want to make me an heir of the shogun , but I would not want to take advantage of the whole country because of his failure . '
In 1860 , he was suspended from house arrest .
In 1862 , the Imperial envoy , Shigetomi OHARA , who was guarded by the soldiers of the Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , went to Edo and ordered him to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as the guardian of the shogun , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA ( Yoshinaga ) to Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On August 6 , the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as Shogun 's guardian and Shungaku as the president of the political affairs .
Yoshinobu and Shungaku implemented the reformation of the shogunate government , which was called Bunkyu Reforms , and established Kyoto shugoshoku ( Military governor of Kyoto ) , <unk> of Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) and so on .
In 1863 , he went up to Kyoto as a pioneer of Iemochi TOKUGAWA , the shogun , to negotiate with the Imperial Court that urged the expulsion of foreigners .
When the Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman - gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , Iemochi received a sword from the Emperor and had to carry out Joi ( expulsion of foreigners ) , so he called himself ' <unk> ' ( a cold fever ) and tried to stop Iemochi 's audience .
After the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians ) led by the Choshu Domain was expelled in the Coup of August 18 , he went to Kyoto again to participate in the Council of Sanyo ( Councilor ) by the Kobu Gattai ( integration of the shogunate and the shogunate ) and Sabaku - ha ( supporters of the Shogun ) .
However , if the conference could not be concluded , he got drunk at drinking parties with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko , and <unk> DATE , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , Shungaku MATSUDAIRA , and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , who were together together with Imperial Prince Asahiko Asahiko Asahiko , and furthermore , he also tried to <unk> him , saying , ' We would not accept the system from Shimazu . '
After that , he stayed in Kyoto and was appointed as the Governor - General of the Imperial Palace , and together with Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Aizu Domain ) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Kuwana Domain ) , the deputy of Shugo ( provincial constable ) , and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of Kuwana Domain ) , who was the lord of Kuwana Domain ) , as well as pro - Imperial supporters of the Imperial Court and the court ( the system of the Kuwana Domain ) .
In the Tenguto War , Kounsai TAKEDA and other vassals of the Mito Domain including Kounsai TAKEDA , who supported Yoshinobu , were <unk> .
In 1864 , in the Kinmon Incident , he commanded the army of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and attacked the Choshu army , which occupied the Takatsukasa residence .
After the first conquest of the Choshu Domain ended , he worked hard for the imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the United States , which had been an imperial sanction , and succeeded in obtaining an Imperial sanction on condition .
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu received an Imperial order to subjugate Choshu .
However , the Satsuma Domain refused to send troops to the Satsuma Domain , which formed the Satsuma - Choshu Alliance , and the bakufu army was defeated .
On August 20 , in the midst of the Second Conquest of Choshu , Shogun Iemochi died at Osaka - jo Castle .
Yoshinobu made a campaign to the Imperial Court and raised an imperial edict to cease - fire , and succeeded in concluding a cease - fire agreement .
He was recommended to be the successor of Iemochi , but Yoshinobu firmly declined it .
On September 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family succeeded to the position of shogun , but he continued to refuse .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) and others requested him to become shogun , but he did not accept it , and on January 5 , he was given the title of Shogun ( from Emperor Komei ) and became shogun .
In other words , it was intended to promote the politics by selling the favor of the shogun .
Yoshinobu established Yokosuka Iron Factory , Construction Construction , and <unk> <unk> with the assistance of <unk> dollars from France through French minister LÃ©on LÃ©on LÃ©on <unk> , and invited military advisers including Jules Brunet to reform the military system .
Also , his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was sent to the Paris World Exposition , and encouraged the students of the shogun 's retainers to study in Europe .
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port , he insisted on the Imperial Court and received an imperial sanction .
On October 14 , 1867 , Yoshinobu , who was forced to go down to Satsuma and Choshu , reported to the Imperial Court that he would return to the government ( Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) ) .
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time judged that there was no administrative ability , and tried to continue the Tokugawa government in the form of a council of feudal lords .
However , due to the plan of Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA , who were aiming to overthrow the Shogunate , the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December , and Yoshinobu was ordered to ' Jikan nochi ' ( the Minister of the Interior and the property of the Tokugawa clan ) .
In order to avoid a conflict , Yoshinobu left the Osaka - jo Castle and gathered foreign ministers and others of foreign countries and insisted on the legitimacy of the Tokugawa shogunate , and furthermore , the Imperial Court requested the Imperial Court to change Jikan - nochi into a gentle form .
However , the following year , 1868 , when the Satsuma Domain was provoked by the Satsuma Domain in Edo , he raised an army and blocked Kyoto with the soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana Domains .
However , in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , which broke out on January 3 , the former Shogunate army faced a disadvantageous situation , and even though they still retained their military strength , they left behind soldiers and withdrew to Edo with " Gunkan " ( military exploits of the bakufu ) .
Soon after that , the Imperial army led by Yoshinobu to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu as an enemy of the Emperor , and the government army led by Prince Arisugawa - no - kami ( Captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards ) and Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started to advance to the east .
Yoshinobu insisted on obedience to the resistance party including Tadaosa OGURI and others .
In February , he entrusted Kaishu KATSU to settle the situation , and he himself confined himself to the Daiji - in Temple of Ueno Kanei - ji Temple .
The head of the Tokugawa family was transferred to his adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU ( later Iesato TOKUGAWA ) .

It seems that when his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA went to sleep in order to make a problem when he was a successor of the Tokugawa family , he had a <unk> ( <unk> ) in order to let his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA succeed to the Tokugawa family succeed to the Tokugawa family , and when he was sleeping , he did not have a mistake in the pillow ( it was just a <unk> , and it seems that he did not have to have a mistake when he was injured ) .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote in which when he came of age , he went to sleep with three wives and concubines as a measure to assassinate him .
Although Yoshinobu was said to have been a photographer in his childhood , it is questionable whether he was Yoshinobu himself .
It is said that he visited Iemochi , who fell ill , to ask him to visit him , and at that time , he had a common conversation .
Tatewaki AJIMA , the biological father of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , was known for his <unk> and praised Yoshinobu as ' a faithful retainer of the Tokugawa family , ' and when Yoshinobu was looking at the expectation of recovery of the Tokugawa clan , he took the role of the Shogun , and then became the ' second of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , ' he was praised by Hideaki .
Hideaki of Yoshinobu was also well known for the anti - shogunate group , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu Domain , especially Takayoshi KIDO , who was a member of the Choshu clan , did not have a good relationship with Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI .
He was wary of Ieyasu 's coming of life . '
In response to the decision of Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , Ryoma SAKAMOTO said , " It is a great place ( shogun ) , and this is the present - day act . "
It is often described as follows .
He praised Yoshinobu as ' I am alive for my loyalty , ' and tried to give him the position of vice chief chancellor of the new government to Yoshinobu .
However , it was in the Meiji period that Yoshinobu knew the existence of Ryoma 's personality ( after Ryoma 's death ) .
This story was not limited to Yoshinobu , and Ryoma 's reputation was very low than that after the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi and ran back to Edo , and was greatly criticized by his enemy 's side by saying ' The enemy of the enemy . '
At that time , there were some people who forgot the <unk> of the <unk> - umajirushi , which had been since Ieyasu 's time , but their favorite favorite concubine was accompanied by him without forgotten .
However , there is also an opinion that it was necessary to resist armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Province , and Yoshinobu had to become an enemy of the Emperor 's enemy , and that there was no way to prevent foreign intervention because he had been able to guard Osaka - jo Castle for a long period of time .
On the other hand , he was regarded as a person who valued the Emperor and the Imperial Court because he was supposed to be an enemy of the Emperor , as well as being confined to Kanei - ji Temple ( it is considered that he had a great influence on Mitogaku ( the scholarship and academic traditions of Mito ) , which was thought to have been a thought of reverence for the Emperor , and his mother was from the Imperial Family ) , but on the other hand , it is also said that he was not satisfied with the enemy as a lord .
Due to the bloodless surrender of Edo - jo Castle and the bloodless surrender of the Edo - jo Castle , the independence of modern Japan was protected and highly evaluated as a great contribution to the Meiji Restoration .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was appointed as the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family , and had a friendly relationship with him even after the Meiji Restoration .
SHIBUSAWA , who wanted to compile a biography of Yoshinobu in his later years , persuaded Yoshinobu to persuade him , and opened the ' <unk> - kai ' ( <unk> - kai ) .
The " <unk> - kai <unk> " ( Notes on the House of Representatives ) was compiled .
In a part of the book , it can be said that Yoshinobu , who was old , can be seen .
When he was at the age of <unk> , he was asked to ask him for a good reason , and said , ' Hisamitsu SHIMAZU did n't like Hisamitsu , ' ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a <unk> person , ' which shows his personality and feelings of him .
Based on these materials , " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA 's official introduction " was completed after Yoshinobu 's death .
In order to show his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji , who gave the title of duke , which was the highest rank of the nobility , he pardoned him as an enemy of the Emperor , and presented his funeral to him instead of a Shinto funeral .
As a result , the grave of Yoshinobu was built not only in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family of the Zojo - ji Temple , which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family , but also in Yanaka Cemetery , there was a round barrow similar to that of the Imperial Family .
This was because the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was impressed by the fact that the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was modest ( " Tokugawa Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA <unk> " ) .
After he was pardoned , Yoshinobu spent his life in a quiet life without thinking of the former Shogun 's retainers who offered his life to him , so Katsukiyo ITAKURA , a roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) at that time , regretted that ' Yoshinobu acted together with Yoshinobu . '
Although he had an image of <unk> in the Battle of Toba - Fushimi , he tried to establish a new modern political system after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and in addition , there was also a movement to re - evaluate Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Historical drama ) as well as Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK ) .
The pork of the Satsuma Domain like his father Nariaki was fond of the Satsuma Domain , and it was called " Hitotsubashi - sama , " which liked pork and pork .
In addition , in his later years , he was interested in Western culture such as bread and milk , and he was interested in his hobbies such as photographs , photographs of a camera , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and handicraft ( embroidery ) , and he also learned French from Amane NISHI ( illuminator ) , however , it seems that he failed .
Although he was famous as a camera , he seems to have never improved the camera skills .
It is said that he frequently contributed to the photo magazines , but it was not adopted for a long time .
His great - grandson , <unk> TOKUGAWA , was also a free - free camera , and his photographs were found in the hands of the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family , including Yoshinobu 's filming , and it was published in the process of editing and editing .
His younger brother , Akitake TOKUGAWA , was a friend of his hobbies .
She married Mikako ICHIJO on December 3 , 1856 ( changed her name to Mikako after the Meiji Restoration ) .

Note
Nara <unk> is a railway line ( main line ) of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) , which runs from Kizu Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) to Kyoto Station in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
The entire line is included in the metropolitan area .
Since the history of the Kansai Main Line has been established as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , the formal starting station is Kizu Station , but on the trains running from Kyoto Station to Kizu Station ( the number of trains is odd ) , the inbound train and the reverse side ( even even in the same number ) are provided .
Except for the following route data , it will be described on the direction of Kizu from Kyoto to Kizu .
The color of the line is brown ( <unk> ) , and the reason for selecting is ' an image of Classic of Classic of Ancient Capital connecting two ancient capitals . '
Jurisdiction ( business type ): West Japan Railway Company ( railway operator )
Railway distance ( operating kilometers ): <unk> km
Track gauge : 1067 mm
Number of stations : 19 ( including the starting and last stations )
Double - tracked section : Shinden - Uji section , JR Fujinomori - Kyoto section
Electrified section : entire line electrified ( DC1500V )
Block system ( railway ) : automatic block system ( double - track section ) , single - track automatic block system ( single track section )
Safety device : Automatic Train Stop device
Operation Center : Shin - Osaka General Control Center
Maximum speed : 110 km / h ( double track section ) , 95 km / h ( single track section )
Except for Kizu Station , Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) Kyoto Branch ( Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company ) .
Although the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line , the entire line is located in Kyoto Prefecture and there is no route in Nara Prefecture .
This was originally constructed by the Nara Railway , but it was separated from the Kizu - south section as a part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the merger of the Kansai Railway Company .
However , the train enters the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) from Kizu Station to Nara Station in Nara Prefecture .
After the revision of March 13 , 1988 , the JR West established a nickname for each line of the Urban Network ( JR Kyoto Line and JR Kobe Line ) , but the Nara Line was sent to the Nara Line .
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is also located on the Kintetsu Nara Line , it is sometimes referred to as the ' JR Nara Line . '
In the era of Japan National Railways , it was described as ' the Nara Line of Japan National Railways ' and the English notation of the guide board was also used .
The Kintetsu Nara Line is related to the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara , and the JR Nara Line is on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line .
While many trains of the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line were operated in parallel with the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line , the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984 at the end of the Japan National Railways , and even after the electrification , it was only a small local line that ran on the JNR Series 105 cars .
However , after the inauguration of JR West , four - car trains ( six - car trains ) were incorporated into the Urban Network and four - car trains were reorganized into four - car trains ( six - car trains ) , double - track trains , double - track trains , and rapid trains , including ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and so on , were rapidly improved .
Currently , it has a strong character as a commuter and school route from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture , such as Uji City , and Joyo City , which are along the line .
However , the section between Momoyama Station and Shinden Station has a large detour on the east side , and the section south of Joyo Station has a gap between the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and the surrounding area , which runs parallel with the central part of the town .
The trains are used by the Nara Train Yard of the Osaka branch , but the station facilities are managed by the Kyoto branch , except for Kizu Station .
At all stations , J - Through , ICOCA , Suica of East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) , and PiTaPa of Surutto KANSAI can be used .
Due to the fact that the station is unmanned in the south of Joyo Station , it becomes a simplified ticket .
Since the Express ' Kuroshio ' , which had been connected by the Nara Line , Sakurai Line , and Wakayama Line in 1984 , was abolished , only local trains were operated by local trains until 1991 ( as for limited express trains , special express trains were operated temporarily for a time ) , and four types of rapid trains and local trains are currently operated .
It is the most rapid type of the Nara Line and is operated mainly in the daytime .
Basically , the train makes a connection with a local train at Uji Station with a local train at the intervals of 30 minutes .
The nickname ' Miyako Miyakoji Rapid Service ' was decided by the general public before the start of the operation .
As a train connecting Kyoto and Nara , it is often used by foreigners not only by Japanese people but also by tourists .
All the trains are operated by the JR West Series 221 and are operated with four cars or six cars .
In the double - track section , the maximum speed is 110 km / h , and other trains are 95 km / h .
The standard required time is about 44 minutes away from Kyoto , and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Kyoto .
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station for two minutes , and therefore , the inbound and outbound trains go to Nara Station , and the required time is slightly different from that of the Miyakoji Rapid Service .
During the three - three days of the new year , the Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari - inari Station .
History
March 3 , 2001 : The operation started .
March 15 , 2003 : Due to the timetable revision , it began to stop at Tofuku - ji Station and Tamamizu Station .
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours .
It also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) , where the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' runs .
All the 221 series are operated with four cars or six cars .
Basically , the train makes a connection with a local train at Uji Station with a local train at the intervals of 30 minutes .
In the same way as the Miyakoji Rapid Service of the Yamatoji Line , the Yamatoji Line stopped at Narayama Station .
Until March 2001 when the ' Miyako <unk> Rapid Service ' appeared , the trains of the JNR / JR Suburban Train Series 117 were used for the trains of Kyoto , Uji , Joyo ( initially passed ) , Kizu and Nara , but since then , they were not used on the Nara Line .
In the morning and evening , there are some trains that run directly to the Yamatoji Line due to the convenience of the operation .
It is operated mainly in the morning and at night .
Although the timetable was revised on March 18 , 2006 , it was also operated on Saturdays and holidays due to the timetable revision .
Although trains stop at every station between Uji Station and Nara Station during the late night , there was a special rapid train heading for Uji Station for the direction of Kizu Station , but now , the local trains running in the section were changed to the final stop at this station .
One train departing from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays uses the JNR 103 series Series 103 , and all trains are operated with the 221 series .
During the morning rush hours , trains run directly from the Yamatoji Line for the convenience of the operation .
The rapid trains of the Nara Line used the same color as the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and the same orange color as the ' Miyakoji Rapid Service ' in order to prevent the <unk> of the Yamatoji Line , but due to the timetable revision made in March 2008 , the timetable was revised , the section of the regional rapid trains came to be used as a green line , and the line was not used as a color of the line .
The timetable on which the station is located to the north of Kamikoma Station is written with purple letters .
It is operated between Kyoto and Uji , Joyo , and Nara .
During the daytime , the section between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station is operated at a 15 - minute interval , but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station becomes a 30 - minute interval .
Basically , the cars are operated on the 103 series , but they are operated with some 221 series .
There are some trains that run directly to the Yamatoji Line during the early morning and late in the morning .
In the past , there were some direct trains with the Sakurai Line , but the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines due to the timetable revision on September 4 , 1994 .
Although it was a special train , limited express trains were also operated on the Nara Line .
From 1987 to 1988 , the ' Kuroshio ' was used as the nickname of ' Kuroshio , ' and from 1988 to 1989 , it was operated by the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line , the Hanwa Line , and the Hanwa Line via the Hanwa Line .
In the Kinki edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun on January 6 , 1998 , there was a report that a limited express train would run on the Nara Line ( as a regular train ) in 2001 , but the plan was cancelled after that .
It was once operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station ( between Kyoto Station and Nara Station ) as the Miyako Leisure Line , but the direct trains were n't operated on the Sakurai Line including temporary trains .
In the middle of August , the Uji - gawa River Fireworks Festival , which is the nearest train to Uji Station , is held , but it is operated during special schedule from 16 to 16:00 , and all local trains run between Kyoto Station and Uji Station for 10 minutes .
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station .
At the time of the first three days of the new year , the special timetable was completed completely , and the rapid train stopped at every station between Kyoto and Uji , and the number of trains was increased and the number of trains was increased to Uji .
Depending on the year , some trains were set up for shuttle trains returning to Momoyama Station .
Around 1992 , the direct train to the Sakurai Line was extended to Tenri Station , mainly on Saturdays and holidays , and the special rapid train was operated for one hour .
In addition , special trains are sometimes available from all over Japan .
In particular , during the Tenri <unk> Festival on October 26 every year , the trains called ' exclusive trains bound for the group ' run from Kyoto Station to Tenri Station via the Nara Line , the Nara Line , and the Yamatoji Line , and the Sakurai Line .
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot .
JR West Suburban Train Series 221
Along with the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line , there are two - car trains , four - car trains , and six - car trains .
It is mainly used for four - car trains and six - car trains in the ' Miyako Rapid Service ' and ' Rapid Service , ' but four - car trains run on the Nara Line .
Two - car trains and two - car trains are used for holidays .
JNR / JR Commuter Train Series 103
The Keihanshin Local Train Series 103 , which is used for local trains on the Nara Line , is not only for the operation of the Nara Line but also for the rapid trains of the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during rush hour .

Keiji Bypass ( <unk> ) is a bypass of general National Highway Road that runs from Kusatsu City , Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama - cho , Kuse - gun , Kyoto Prefecture .
It was designated as a local standard project .
The Keiji Bypass , a toll road , explains the Keiji Bypass as follows , and the Keiji Bypass of National Highway 1 and National Route 24 will be described as follows :
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway and connects with the Otsu City and Kyoto City area , and connects with the Ritto Interchange , Nagoya City , Suita Interchange , and Osaka City area .
According to the law , the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange are National Route 1 and 478 , and the Kumiyama - Yodo Interchange ( Keiji Bypass ) , the Kumiyama Interchange - Yodo Junction - the Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama Interchange - the Kumiyama - Yodo Junction - sen Junction - National Highway Road ( general National Highway Road ) , which was designated as the National Highway Highway Highway 478 and the National Highway Road ( Kyoto Jukan Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) , and the Kumiyama Jidoshado Expressway ( Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) , the Kumiyama Interchange and Kumiyama - Yodo Junction ( Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway ) are the names of the National Expressway ( Chuo Expressway ) .

The Kyoto Jukan Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway are designated as National Route 478 and have consistently been maintained .
According to the indication of the route , the Keiji Bypass is considered to be the Keiji Bypass in Seta Junction - Oyamazaki Junction , which is easier to understand by users .
In addition , even if the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass pass pass through either of them , the fare fee and the ETC discount system are not different .
If otherwise specified , the Keiji Bypass ( from the Seta - higashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki Junction ) , as a commercial name , will be explained .

The Uji Tunnel of this route is the longest tunnel among the National Route 1 , and it is forbidden to change the lane in the tunnel except for the Uji - higashi Interchange and the Kasatori Interchange .
Prior to the opening of the Kumiyama Junction , the film " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " was shot in front of the Kumiyama Junction .
Seta - higashi Interchange - The distance of Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT is slightly shorter than the Meishin Expressway , and if the Keiji Bypass runs at the highest speed , it is more accessible to the destination via Keiji Bypass .
Since there are no rest space in the service area , it is often crowded with Meishin Expressway ( there are two locations : the Otsu Service Area , the Katsura Parking Area and the Katsura Parking Area ) .
However , the structure of both Seta Higashi - Seta and Oyamazaki Junction was established using the <unk> of the Meishin Expressway ( especially , the structure of Oyamazaki Junction became extremely complicated ) , which led to the decrease of the lights ( high - speed road ) .
In the case of the transfer from Oyamazaki Junction to Suita Junction and Osaka area , there is a fault that if the Meishin Expressway is merged with the Meishin Expressway and the left route of the Meishin Expressway , there is an obstacle to traffic .
In addition , since there are many drivers who want to avoid such curves and slopes on the way , they do not function sufficiently as a bypass of Meishin Expressway .
In addition , this road is a bypass of National Highway 1 ( National Route 1 ) , so it is an exclusive road for automobiles and is not a highway .
If you pass the Keiji Bypass in the direction of Suita and Osaka on the east side of the Uji - gawa River , you must go to the Uji - nishi Interchange .
This is because the Uji - higashi Interchange is half - IC .
For this reason , the section between the Uji - higashi Interchange and the Uji - nishi Interchange is often congested .
Because this general road section is not connected to the <unk> , it is difficult to avoid traffic congestion .

The temple was located at Shichijo , Karasuma , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , and it came to be called Higashi Hongan - ji Temple because it was located in the east of Nishi Hongan - ji Temple located at Horikawa Shichijo , Horikawa Shichijo .
In 1987 , Hongan - ji Temple as a religious corporation , which had been integrated with Otani School , was legally dissolved as a religious corporation , and was integrated with the sect .
After that , the formal name of Higashi Hongan - ji Temple became ' Shinshu Hon - byo ' ( ' Hon - byo ' means the fundamental dojo ( training hall ) that the followers of <unk> accompanied Shinran heard the teachings of Shinran , the founder of the sect .
It also means to distinguish it from the Hongan - ji school of Jodo Shinshu ( the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) .
Refer to the East Riot .

In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' is referred to as ' <unk> . '
It is a god who deified the sun and is considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial Family .
In " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is described as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
It is also called <unk> no Kami or <unk> no Kami .
In the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , several gods were described , while in " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , they were unified into the name of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Although she is a goddess , there is another theory that she was a male god .
Based on the fact that the shinmei ( name of god ) of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was used in political parts such as " Kotai Kotai - jingu <unk> " ( the list of Kotai - jingu Shrine ) , there is a theory that Takamimusubi ( Takamimusubi no Mikoto ) and Tsutomu <unk> ( Takamimusubi no Mikoto ) were originally the ancestor of the Imperial Family , and <unk> became Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
In Ise - jingu Shrine , it is usually referred to as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , or Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , or Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , or Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) at the time of rites and festivals .
In an academic document , ' Amaterasu ' and ' <unk> ' are practiced at present .
There is a theory that it was written as Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) in ancient times .
Description in mythology
According to " Kojiki " ( The Records of Ancient Matters ) , when Izanagi returned from the Yominokuni ( the land of the dead ) where Izanami lived , she was born when she washed her left eye .
At that time , he was called Mihashira no uzuno miko ( three children ) along with Tsukuyomi , who was born from the right eye , and Susano who was born from his nose .
At that time , Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to govern Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
Susano , who was entrusted with the ocean , wanted to go to Nenokuni ( the underworld ) of Izanami , so he was expelled by Izanagi .
Susanoo went to Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) to meet his older sister Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) before he went to Nenokuni , but Amaterasu Omikami thought that his younger brother came from Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) and waited for him .
In order to prove Susano 's innocence , Susano made a pledge to prove Susano 's innocence , and a five - god god god god from Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , Susano 's real god , and Susano 's three female gods were born from Susano , and Susano declared his victory .
It was born from the fact of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and was regarded as the son of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and was the following five deities .
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
<unk> ( <unk> )
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo , who was pleased with this , made a violent act in Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) , and as a result , Amaterasu Omikami hid in Ama no iwato ( Cave of heaven ) .
The world became in the darkness and various misfortunes occurred .
( Yaoyorozu no mikoto , such as <unk> no Mikoto , the god of wisdom , and <unk> no mikoto , succeeded in producing Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) from Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and Susano was expelled from Takamanohara ( plain of high heaven ) .
He descended to Ashihara no nakatsukuni ( Literally , " Central Land of Reed Plains " ) to pray for Amenooshihomimi 's son , and sent Amatsu kami ( heavenly god ) .
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni was subdued , Amenooshihomimi finally came to earth , but Ninigi was born , so Ninigi 's grandson Ninigi descended to earth .
<unk> interpretation
In the mythology , there is a scene in which Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) prayed to the god of heaven ( Takamimusubi ) who was born earlier than him and followed him , and therefore , Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is considered to have been deified as the Emperor who ruled the country by performing religious services ( religious services ) .
There is also a view that she was deified as a shrine maiden in ancient times .
The other name ' <unk> ' is ' Hi no onna ' ( a woman of the sun ) and refers to a shrine maiden serving the sun god .
Although the sun god was originally a male god , there is a theory that a shrine maiden who served it was equated with the sun god and became a goddess .
It is also said that this goddess was established around the time of Empress Jito , who was an empress , or that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
It has been pointed out that the birth of the sun of Amaterasu Omikami ( Sun Goddess ) , Tsukuyomi , the sun of Tsukuyomi , was strongly influenced by Dokyo as ' the sun of the sun and the moon ' ( prior to the sixth century ) in " Reiho <unk> " ( Five Sacred Treasures of the Sacred Treasures ) , and " <unk> " ( Early 7th century ) ( the beginning of the seventh century ) that ' the eyes of the left and the right eyes of the sun are the sun of the sun of the sun and the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun . '
It is also said that the terms such as Okami ( great god ) of Ise - jingu Shrine that enshrines Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , jingu Shrine , Saigu ( Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise - jingu Shrine ) , <unk> ( <unk> no miya ) , Murasaki no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Toyouke no Okami also correspond to Dokyo .
In comparison , it is pointed out that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and others were almost identical with the <unk> myth , which has been recorded in the older period ( three to fourth centuries ) .
Since it is a universal <unk> which spread throughout Asia , there is also a theory that it was a myth that spread to Japan along with the ethnic groups in the prehistoric times .
In " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the divinity changed into three stages .
The following is a summary of the incident and the contents of the incident , which is the turning point .
645 : Taika Reforms
The Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami before this time .
The word ' <unk> ' refers to the sun .
A male god named ' <unk> ' was enshrined widely .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines that read ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' such as ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Tsushima , ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Harima Province and ' <unk> - jinja Shrine ' in Tanba .
Incidentally , <unk> is another name for Amenohoakari , a grandson of Amaterasu , and Amenohoakari is also the founder of the Owari clan , Tsumori clan , and Amabe clan .
The younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi and was a great - grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : The Jinshin War .
It is also called ' <unk> no <unk> ' or ' <unk> no <unk> ' or ' <unk> no <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In this case , there is an interpretation that the enshrined deity is <unk> no <unk> ( <unk> ) , and it is interpreted as ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) of male male gods .
698 : Founded by Kotai - jingu Shrine .
Amaterasu ' and ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family . '
She is a goddess .
It was created from nature god to humanized divinity as a model for Empress Jito .
After that , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) other than the Imperial Family was called ' <unk> ' ( the Sun Goddess ) .
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( around 1060 ) , the part of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' is read as ' <unk> ' and also in ' <unk> ' of " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
1880 - 1881 , over the enshrined deity of Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto Jimukyoku ) in Hibiya , Tokyo , a religious dispute arose in the Shinto religion .
The Shinto Jimukyoku decided to enshrine the four gods of creation ( Ame no Minakanushi no Kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Takamimusubi no kami , Kamimusubi no kami ) and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) as the enshrined deity in the shrine of the clerical bureau , but ' Izumo - ha ' ( the Izumo school ) insisted that the enshrined deity should be enshrined as ' <unk> ' ( the same as the other world ) and ' <unk> ' ( the realm of the world and the realm of the world ) , and the five deities should be controlled by Okuninushi ( god of Izumo ) .
However , the ' Ise - ha ' ( the Ise school ) , which played the central role of the Shinto Jimukyoku , was ' the supreme leader of the heaven and earth ' that Amaterasu Omikami ruled Ryokai Ryokai ( the Two Realms Realms ) , and the other gods insisted that they were too loyal to them , and the both sides opposed each other .
As a result , there were various rumors , such as ' the Izumo school of the Izumo - ha ( Izumo school of Buddhism ) has a long time since the age of gods ' and ' the <unk> of the House of Sen , who has a <unk> heart in the Imperial Family , shall be killed . '
Later , this dispute was settled by the decision of Emperor Meiji ( the Izumo school was defeated ) , and the divinity of Amaterasu Omikami was ranked at the highest rank .
It is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of the creed system common to Shinto , and that the modern nation recognized the possibility that it would directly control the people directly through the restoration Shinto teachings .
Refer to a dispute over the enshrined deity of State Shinto Shinto Jimukyoku ( Shinto Jimukyoku ) .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA used " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , another name of " <unk> " ( <unk> ) for his own novel , " <unk> " ( <unk> ) .
This is because the name ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) came to appear in the following sentences , therefore , the sun god and the nature of nature were called ' <unk> ' and the word ' <unk> ' was used .
In fact , in the novel of Akutagawa , there were many people who could not correct , corrections , corrections , and corrections by the command of the army .
<unk> YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who founded <unk> Gakuin in 1926 , said ' Japan has faith in Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) .
Amaterasu Omikami is an ideal to <unk> the world of Japanese spirit .
The ideal of Izanami and Izanagi 's ' <unk> ' is to say that in other words , it is a pioneer of the world , a pioneer , and a pioneer of the world . '
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami are called Shinmei - jinja Shrine , and all over the country are located in the Inner Shrine ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) of Ise - jingu Shrine .
The Kotai - jingu Shrine enshrines one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family , Yata no Kagami ( Yata no Kagami ) , which is one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family .
At most shrines throughout Japan , the talisman ( taima ) of Kotai - jingu Shrine ( Kotai - jingu Shrine ) was distributed .
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) was a term derived from a large - scale village headman .
The word " <unk> " refers to a great number of people .
Shomyo ( Buddhist invocation ) is said to have become a Buddhist priest .
He said that he had a strong power in the region .
In the samurai society , it came to mean a samurai who owned many shoryo ( territory ) and subordinates .
In the Muromachi period , shugo strengthened their control over their territories and became shugo daimyo ( provincial military governor ) .
In the Sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , a powerful feudal lord who established strong control of his own territory appeared and was called Kokujin ( local samurai ) and Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period ) .
In the Edo period , it came to refer to samurai families that were given more than 10,000 koku ( approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield ) by the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
Among the samurai who were less than 10,000 koku , samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called direct retainers .
Daimyo ( feudal lord ) were called daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) because they shared the character of feudal lords in China , and they were called feudal lords .
This section explains the details of the early - modern daimyo in the Edo period .
For the details of Shugo daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) and Sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period ) , refer to this article .
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) in the Edo period
Daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) in the Edo period were determined based on kakaku ( family status ) , Ikai ( official rank ) , kokudaka ( stipend ) , and shikoseki ( anteroom seats in the Edo period ) .
First , due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family , it was classified into Fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) , which had been a vassal of the Tokugawa family , Fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) , and Tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) which had been a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara .
Ieyasu , the first shogun , established the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was permitted to use the family name of the Tokugawa gosanke ( three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family ) , which was allowed to use the family name of Tokugawa as well as to assist the shogun family , as well as to support the shogun family , and appointed the eleventh son of Yorinobu TOKUGAWA , the 11th son of Kishu Domain , and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA to the Mito Domain .
In addition , he appointed Hideyasu YUKI , the second son of Ieyasu and the second son of Hidetada TOKUGAWA , to Echizen Domain , and established a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) of the Tokugawa family throughout the country .
In addition , he placed fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) as fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) and secured the military power of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) as an important post , leading to the roju ( senior councilor ) of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , such as Tairo ( chief minister ) and roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) in the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
Fudai daimyo ( hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) were relatively low , and in addition , the Torii clan , the Sakakibara clan , the Honda clan , the Honda clan , and the Ogasawara clan were relatively <unk> , but the fudai daimyo ( a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family ) who maintained more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period , including the Sakai clan , the Abe clan , the Hotta clan , the Hotta clan , the Yanagisawa clan , and the Toda clan .
This led to the separation of power and military power .
After the Battle of Sekigahara , tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) were subordinated to the Tokugawa family , and many families were opposed to the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara .
As a result , the bakufu was strongly wary of the bakufu and actively engaged in intelligence activities by spy , and if there were fear of illegal activities and rebellion , they were strictly punished by being deprived of their fief .
As the most famous tozama daimyo ( nonhereditary feudal lord ) of the Maeda clan , the Kaga Domain of the Maeda clan , the Sendai Domain of the Shimazu clan , the Fukuoka Domain of the Kuroda clan , the Okayama Domain , the Choshu Domain of the Mori clan , the Aizu clan , the Choshu clan of the Mori clan , the Yonezawa Domain of the Mori clan , the Yonezawa Domain of the Saga - Uesugi clan , the Okayama Domain , the Okayama Domain , the Hachisuka clan of the Okayama Domain , and the Satake clan of the Okayama Domain , as well as the Satake clan of the Okayama Domain .
In addition , when a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) stayed in Edo - jo Castle in Edo - jo Castle , a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) who had a territory equivalent to a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) or a fief equivalent to a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) , a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) who had a castle with a daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) and jinya ( regional government office ) were differentiated from a daimyo ( feudal lord ) .
For more information , refer to " shikoseki . "
In spite of the level of daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) , the daimyo ( Japanese feudal lord ) with 100,000 koku were not allowed to possess a total of 100,000 koku , and most of them had territories around the castle town and spots .
In extreme cases , one village was divided into another feudal lord ( <unk> ) .
Daimyo were generally more than 10,000 koku , but the Kitsuregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was 5,000 koku of the Kitsuregawa clan .
This is because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan .
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of Buke Shohatto ( Laws for the Military Houses ) and Sankinkotai ( a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo ) .
In addition , they were also ordered to defend the seashore at the end of the Edo period , and daimyo were always in financial difficulties .
