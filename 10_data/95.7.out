It is said that he was born as a son of FUJIWARA no Koreko, who was a daughter of Michichika and Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state) Motofusa MATSUDONO (FUJIWARA no Motofusa FUJIWARA) in Matsudono Villa in Kohata in Kyoto, but recent researchers believe that he was the biological child of his foster father, Michichika Horikawa-dori Street.
There is also a theory that he was a son of Michichika's son, MINAMOTO no Michimune or Michimitsu KOGA.
According to the "Kensei Jinkaiki" (a history book of private sectors), he lost his father (Michichika) at the age of three, and became an adopted child of his older paternal half-brother, Michichika HORIKAWA, at the age of eight.

In July 1243, he was invited by Yoshishige HATANO, a jito (manager and lord of manor) of Echizen Province, and moved to Shibisuso in Echizen Province.
On the way, Nobutsuna SASAKI, the feudal lord of Kutsuki-mura Village invited him to Kutsuki-mura Village (the origin of Kosho-ji Temple in Takashima City).
In 1244, he opened Daibutsu-ji Temple in Kasamatsu.
In 1246, Daibutsu-ji Temple changed its name to Eihei-ji Temple and his go (pen name) was changed to Maregen.
At this time, he went down to Kamakura by the invitation of regent Tokiyori HOJO, Yoshishige HATANO and others.
It was in Kamakura for a half years, but it became the beginning of pure Zen prosperity in the Kanto region.
In 1253, he handed over Eihei-ji Temple to his disciple Ejo KOKUN, and he died at the age of 54 at the age of 54 at the age of 54 at the residence of his secular disciple Kakuen (Takakura-dori Street, Kyoto City).
It is said that the cause of his death is a cryster.
Even if it was not completed by a certain level of time, even if it became a Buddha, even if it became a Buddha, it was a true practice to keep the ascetic practices of Buddha (Shuichi Ichinyo, the true nature of the Buddha), and that it was the ultimate practice of sitting meditation.
Many of the Kamakura Bukkyo are aware of the Mappo-shiso (theory of the end of the world), but it is not completely different from the fact that the book was written in the record of the Shosobogenzo-ki (record of the record of the Buddhist priest of the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests).
It is a convenient for a period of time in which a statue is placed at the end of the statue.
The true teaching of Sanezane is not accepted.
It should be read as "yorisen."
He was not always victorious in his lifetime.
There is also an inevitable decision, such as the Asama Shikike (Asama in the light of the mind) and the Shimotane (lower root of the mind).
The precepts of Buddhism and various kinds of Buddhist precepts are given to all living things and people who are in charge of the precepts of Buddhism and the like.
It is the opportunity for all people to be a Buddha.
He thought that he could not always be able to be a person who was a disciple of Shaka, and he pointed out that he could not be a person who was a disciple of Shakyamuni, and he denied the Mappo (end of the world) which was just a convenient preaching.

Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a storage facility for steam locomotives that are operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Kankiji-cho, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, Japan National Railway's 100th anniversary of the establishment of Japan Railway Company (JR West) was established in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, and steam locomotives that had been supported by Japan Railway Company (JR West) were regarded as valuable cultural properties and the first facility for the purpose of preservation.
In 1987, JR West took over the division and privatization of JNR.
The facility itself is the site of the current rolling stock (Umekoji Line), and it is also conducted by the Japan National Railways D1010 which is owned by the Sagano Scenic Railways, as well as inspecting and repairing.
In the first place, this facility became the beginning of the establishment of this facility, and it was because the steam locomotive disappeared rapidly from the latter half of 1960s.
At first, the Oyama-ku district located in Oyama, Tochigi Prefecture is the nearest site of the capital area, but it is the most likely candidate for preservation, and it was officially selected as a preservation institution in 1970 because the site was located in the 'central part of Japan' because it was located in the precincts of the Oyama premises of Tochigi Prefecture.
In principle, the cars for preservation were examined to be selected, but there were some cars that were not able to be preserved at first, such as C22, C22.
The facilities are composed of the "Steam Locomotive Exhibition Hall," which utilizes the former Umekoji Organ Steam Locomotive Plain, and the former Nijo building was reconstructed and reconstructed and reconstructed and reconstructed as "Materials Exhibition Hall."
The Ogata Kuri was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914 and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the five-tentative ceiling, the ceiling, and the Hikomi Line was designated as a national important cultural property.
In the same year, in 2004, he was selected as the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology for the Protection of Cultural Properties.
In 2006, the former Nijo Station building (exhibition) and the Ogi-shako Depot and the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the construction of the railway were designated as a national treasure.
The former Nijo station building was built in 1904 with the oldest wooden building in Japan where the Kyoto Railway Company (JR West) was constructed as the main shrine, and it was designed to imitate Heian-jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape.
The Kyoto Railway was nationally nationalized in 1907, and after that, it was used as a station building for JR West as a station building for elevation between Nijo Station and Hanazono Station on the Sanin Main Line (Sagano Line), but in 1996, it was restored and reconstructed as a station building, and the interior of the station building was used as a relay site in 1997.
It was designated as a cultural property of Kyoto City in April 1996.
The Ogata Kuri has 16 domestic steam locomotives produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period, and 16 types of domestic steam locomotives (16 ryo at the beginning of the opening) which have been produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period are displayed.
At the beginning of the opening, there were two cars of C53 cars and C51 cars of C51 and 2399 cars of C51 were registered in the Ministry of Education, but it has been decided that the storage machine has seven cars in 2006.
On the other hand, five cars are registered even now, and two cars (C5571 and C5516) are served on the Yamaguchi Line as 'Yamaguchi (train)' or 'Kitabiko (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line and so on.
Although the motivation machine other than these two cars is not available, it cannot be carried out on the Tokaido Main Line because there are no inspection in all directions.
In addition, the 'SL Squart' is operated by the track of the railway in the vicinity of the museum.
This exhibition line was once located north from the depot to the north of the current large-size parking park, but it was changed to the north of the former Nijo Station and the current site was moved to the north of the site where the current Umekoji Park was located in the vicinity of the former Nijo Station and the south end of the current Umekoji Park was running through the Sagano Line.
Even now, it has functions as an institution and is also connected to the business route.
Furthermore, after the Takadori factory of West Japan Railway Company (JR West) was closed, steam locomotives were also developed.
Baime
It comes from 'Ume' which means Umekoji Station.
The entire car except the C62 series which had been designated in 1976, was designated as a quasi-railway monument, along with the list of the cars of the C62 cars and the conservative tools.
In 1972, those without special notable items have been handed down from the former institute district of 1972 to the procedures of transmission from the previous organization.

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music.
It is a religious music used for rituals and ceremonies.
In Japan, it is also called Babai or Bonbogu.
In the old style, it was written as myo.
It is one of the studies of ancient India.
Gogyo refers to five kinds of vocational schools, such as Shomyo (learning of phonology and the grammar of Chinese language), Kyoryo (technology), Kyoryo (study of techniques and technics), Iho (medical sciences), Inmei (ethics (ethic), Naimei (learning of one's own sect), and so on.
It has been handed down along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in 754 during the Buddhist memorial service held at the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple, and it is believed that Shomyo was popular in the Nara period.
In the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai passed the voice and became the basis of the Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo.
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect have their own voices and are still inherited today.
In order to pass down the oral tradition of kuden, there were no gakufu (musical instruments).
As a result, the denju became difficult.
Later, hakase, who was a gakufu (musical instrument), was invented.
There are differences in terms of specialized terms such as hakase depending on each school.
However, Hakase was a reference, and if they tried to learn Shomyo (Shomyo in Japanese), they were required to teach Shomyo (Shomyo), and they were not able to maintain and inherit the school from the master to disciples.
For this reason, the training of the leaders and successors was required.
Many schools became extinct due to various conditions.
The Tendai Shomyo sect was introduced by Saicho and became the basis of its own development.
After Saicho, Ennin and Anzen became prosperous.
Ryonin who was the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu is known as the restorer of the family.
In 1109, Ryoin built Raigo-in Temple in Ohara in Kyoto (Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City).
The honorific mountain prefix of Raigo-in Temple in Ohara was changed to Gyosan, the birthplace of Chinese Shomyo in China, and was called Uozan.
Before long, the two temples of Raigo-in Temple and Shorin-in Temple came to be known as the dojo for Shomyo of the Ohara school.
In addition, Jakurehara later formed a group, and in Ohara there was a voice of two branches.
Later, Sokai revived the Ohara Shomyo.
Tanchi built a new theory based on the theory of music.
Since then, the center of the Tendai Shomyo sect was handed down to the current Tendai Shomyo.
The Yuzu Nenbutsu, Jodoshu sect, Jodo Shinshu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect Shomyo are descended from the Tendai Shomyo sect.
Shingon-Shomyo is based on the introduction of Kukai and continues to this day.
It has been after the Shinga period when Shomyo has been systematized.
Kancho can be said to be the restorer of the family.
He worked as a composer and improvement of Shomyo.
There were many schools until the Kamakura period, but it was compiled by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho, by four schools (Honsoin school, Shingonin, Daigo and Nakagawa Daishin).
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period.
The Honsoin school and the Shinkoin-ryu and Daigo schools were abolished until the middle of the Meiji period.
At present, it is divided into Chizan (Chishaku-in Temple, Kyoto, Chishaku-in Temple), Buzan (Mt. Buzan) and Nanzan Shinryu (Nanzan school, Mt. Koya, Kyoto and Kogi Shingon sect).
The Ryomei school originated from the Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo (Shomyo Shomyo of Shingi Shingon sect), the Shingon sect Chizan school, the Buzan school of the Shingon sect and the Buzan school of the Shingon sect and both of them originated from the Nakagawa Daishin school.
Raiyu adopted the old school of Daigo.
When Negoro-ji Temple (Wakayama Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583, both Chizan and Toyosan, formed a new school based on the old school of Daigo.
The characteristic is that it is called 'ronron' (論論論) of Mt. Toyama, 'ron' (論論論) and 'shomyo' (明明) of Mt. Chizan.
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school of the Nanzan Shingon-shu sect (Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect) was the origin of the Nakagawa school.
The Nakagawa Daishinryu school was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa Temple in Nara Prefecture.
He moved his base to Mt. Koya from 1232 to 1233.
It was also called Mt. Koya, and it was called Nanzan Shinryu.
It is also called Shinryu or Noyama Shinryu.
It can be said that songs such as Heikyoku (Noh song), Yokyoku (Noh song), Minyo (folk song), and Joruri (dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment) were transformed into voices.
It is greatly influenced by a single melody music.
Emperor Tenchi (also known as Emperor Tenchi) was Emperor Tenchi.
He was a man.

He was the thirty-eighth Emperor.
His shigo (posthumous name) was Ame no Mikoto, Ame no Sumeramikasu no Mikoto (also known as Amehime no Mikoto.
His posthumous name was Kazuraki or Katsuragi.

His mother was Princess Hosho (later Empress Kogyoku).
The empress was Yamatohime no Okimi, a daughter of Furuhito no Oe no Oe no Oenomiko, who was her older paternal half-brother.
He conspired with NAKATOMI no Kamatari, and killed SOGA no Iruka and enthroned his uncle, Emperor Kotoku, and became Crown Prince.
Then, the Taika era was established, and various reforms were carried out (the central figure of the Taika Reforms, Isshi no hen (Isshi no hen [Isshi Incident]).
In addition, he made a coup d'etat after the death of Prince Arima, such as Prince Arima and so on to create a coup d'etat (coup d'etat caused by a coup d'etat by a coupon).'
Since Baekje was destroyed by Tang and Silla in 660 in 660, he sent Kudara no Oji (Prince Kudara), Buyeo Pung who had been staying in the Imperial Court, and tried to rebuild Paekche as well.
He stayed in Tsukushi Province in order to command the rescue of Paekche, but in 661, Emperor Saimei passed away.
After that, the Imperial Throne did not ascend for a long time, but in 663 he suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of Hakusukinoe, he moved to Otsu City and ascended the throne.

However, in the Jinshin War which occurred after the death of Emperor Tenchi, his younger brother Oama (Emperor Tenmu) won the victory of Prince Otomo and ascended the throne.
After that, the Emperor Shotoku succeeded to the throne until the reign of Emperor Tenmu.
After the death of Emperor Shotoku, the grandson of Emperor Tenchi, Shirakabe no okimi ascended the throne as Emperor Konin, and after that, it became the Tenchi lineage.

Saimei July 24, 661 - Shosei
On February 20, 668, he succeeded to the throne.
January 7, 672 - He died at the age of 46.
(According to "Fuso Ryakki" (A Brief History of the Fuso era), there is a theory that the Emperor Tenmu was assassinated by the Emperor Tenmu after the death of a disease, saying that 'one is the palanquin of the Emperor in the palanquin and the other is not known because the mountain where the mountain is far from the mountain is far from the mountain where there is no time to be dead.'
It is one of the mysteries of politics in the middle of the seventh century that Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time and was not enthroned.
There are several theories about this theory.
This is the consideration for the power of the Emperor Tenmu.
In other words, Emperor Tenmu, who is believed to have been a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, is wrong, and it is based on the theory that Emperor Tenmu was born before Emperor Kogyoku got married to Emperor Jomei, and that he was an older brother of Emperor Tenchi.
It is certain that the year of Emperor Tenmu was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenchi in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and some of the history books of the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) at the age of the Emperor Tenmu, and Emperor Tenmu became the longer.
However, there are no contradictions in the same historical material, and there are many historical materials that contain the difference between the age of 8 and 99.
On the other hand, there is an opinion that 'the father is different from his father, but the younger brother is bad and it is true that the age of Tenchi's father Emperor Jomei was the age of 16 when the Emperor Jomei ascended the throne was enthroned, but the age of 16 was different from the age of his father.
Therefore, the year of his birth is 614, which is the year of the birth of the Emperor Honcho was adopted, and it is said that he was born in 614.
There was a counterargument that "Koji" was not rare in ancient times, and Tenchi and Minto, who had reigned around the time of Emperor Tenmu's reign, held the Shosei system and did not ascend to the throne.
It is said that there was a mistake in order to avoid mistake.
There is also a theory that it is pointed out that other history books which have been pointed out as 'Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)' are different from the fact that they were compiled in the same period as the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) are not treated as the same.
(Also refer to the article on the age of Emperor Tenmu.)
It is said that the Isshi Incident was a coup d'etat caused by Prince Karu (Emperor Kotoku), and Naka no Oe was expelled from the position.
In recent years, the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji and SOGA no Iruka is relatively good and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to the basic policy.
When Naka no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oe no Oji killed Iruka.
In addition, in the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) there is a theory that this theory was based on the fact that it was changed to the Taika Reforms.
In this theory, the reason for the abdication of the Emperor Kogyoku and the reason that the Soga clan other than Iruka could not be expelled after the coup d'etat and other doubts can be explained as well.
There is a theory that the enthronement of the Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to opposition from the relationship between the women of the Emperor Tenchi.
It is said that Emperor Kotoku, who was described in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), showed the relationship between her and Tenchi in the poem that she was a wife of the Emperor and a daughter of the same mother of the Emperor Tenchi.
Although the love and marriage between her half brother and sisters were allowed to be allowed to be forgiven, she was actually in love with the older brother of the same mother, but there were some interpretations that she had a relationship with her uncle, Michiko SATONAKA, and even after she got married to her uncle, Prince Karu (Emperor Kotoku).
After the death of Empress Saimei, the Imperial Princess Hashihito succeeded to the throne as the empress of the previous Emperor, but there is a theory that the records were lost due to some circumstances.
In "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), there is a theory that the Emperor came from the theory that he was a princess, and it can be interpreted that the term 'Chuko no Mikoto' can be interpreted as the Emperor who succeeded to the throne until the enthronement of Emperor Tenji.
If Hashihito no Himemiko = 'Naka no Mikoto,' it can be said that the reason why she had to be called 'Nakanomikoto,' but there is a theory that Empress Saimei was not certain.
Although it is difficult to prove the nature of political history and historical materials, it is difficult to prove it, and the study of research has been progressed, including the cooperation of archaeologists and so on.
Poems
He was also a waka poet of Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) that four poems were handed down to Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Tanka-poems in the Heian period, the following poem is included in the beginning of the poem.

The Saionji family was a court noble who belonged to the Fujiwara clan.
He was from the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and his family status was Seiga (the second highest family status for court nobles).
The Toin family and the Imadegawa family were divided into the Saionji family.
In addition, the Saionji clan in Iyo Province was a powerful branch of the Saionji clan, who used the family name of Saionji.
The family crest is made of the left trips.
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no Kinzane.
When Michisue's great-grandchild Kintsune SAIONJI had a niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, he was caught by the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and was confined to the Imperial Court as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and after the Jokyu War, he was trusted by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and gained the real power of the Imperial Court as Kanto moshitsugi (liaison of the Kanto region) and gained the social status of Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).
The name of the Saionji family comes from the name of the temple that Kintsune built in his villa in Kyoto (Kitayama-mura, Kadono County, Yamashiro Province).
This hall was also called Kitayama-dono, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA by the Saionji family.
After Kintsune, he was supported by the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and in the Kamakura period, he also gained the power of Sekke (line of regents and advisers).
Sanekane SAIONJI approached the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama), and he put his daughter to the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo.
However, after his son, Kinhira SAIONJI, the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) came to have a distance from the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and he supported the Jimyoin line and deepened the confrontation with Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama).
After that, when Kinmune SAIONJI died, the Kamakura bakufu fell, and he was dismissed from the position of Kanto moshitsugi.
Kinmune sheltered Yasuie HOJO, who was a remnant of the Hojo clan, and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration, and planned to install the Retired Emperor Go-Fushimi, and Kinmune was arrested due to the betrayal of his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI.
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, Sanetoshi SAIONJI who was a son of Kinmune served the Northern Court, served as Udaijin (minister of the right) and restored the family name.
He was also known as a family of biwa (Japanese lute) in the Muromachi period and the Edo period.
In the early Edo period, Saneharu SAIONJI welcomed Tokuhime who was the eldest daughter of Tadataka HOSOKAWA (later disinherited later)), who was the heir of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA (later became disinherited) and was appointed to Sadaijin (Minister of the Left), but Kyumu NAGAOKA donated 600 koku (crop yields) to the Saionji family and donated 600 koku (crop yields).
In the end of the Edo period, Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted by the Tokudaiji family of the Kanin school, and after the Meiji Restoration, he was active as a politician, and he became a Genro (elder statesman) in the political world of the Taisho and Showa periods.
Although Kinmochi, who was the family business of the Saionji family, was a hard-liner of biwa (Japanese lute), which was said to be a bad play by the Emperor Meiji during his prime minister, he was said to be 'a biwa (Japanese lute) of the Saionji family,' and it is said that he played the role of gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music) musicians and biwa biwa (Japanese lute) in the Ministry of the Imperial Household.

"Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) is an essay which is said to have been written by Sei Shonagon, a female writer in the mid Heian period.

He was also called "Seishonagon ki" (diary of Sei Shonagon).
He had a great influence on renga (linked verse), haikai (seventeen-syllable verse) and kana zoshi (草草子), which were different from the "Tale of Genji."
Together with "Hojo ki" written by KAMO no Chomei and "Tsurezuregusa" by Kenko YOSHIDA, he is referred to as one of the three greatest history and wind in Japan.

According to the postscript, when Naidaijin (minister of the center) FUJIWARA no Korechika presented a paper which was expensive at that time to his younger sister, FUJIWARA no Teishi, and Emperor Ichijo, the emperor was asked to write the "History of the Emperor" but Sei Shonagon responded to the Imperial Court in the end of the book.
The reason why the book was given by the Imperial Court was given by the third line was that 'Noin no Hazamurai' was an incomplete version of Noinobon (Noinobon version of the third volume, and Noin no Honbon is an article in Sakaibon and Maeda manuscript.)
It is commonly accepted that the name of "Makura no soshi" comes from this.
According to "Sakura no soshi" (Study of the Pillow Book) written by Kazuhiko HAYASHI, he was a researcher of his own theory and his past Keichu ORIGUCHI, Nobuo ORIGUCHI and Kikan IKEDA.

Theory: Share: 'Shiki-ki (the history of the history)=>Shiki-ta-makura (the pillow of Shiki [History of the Rituals [History of the Ritual] => Shiki-fu [Furod]) is a pun on the verb of the verb called 'Shiki-makura.'
The theory of the novelist is that many chapters are composed of Utamakura, Shintoku, and Raju.
Remarks: The term of "Sarazenroku" refers to Zoshi (herbs) that should be used as sonkoroku (record of the deceased) in the pillow as a supplementary record.

Even after that, there were some books which seem to have been written in the end of the 1000's, and it seems that it was written around the end of the Heian period.
The text of "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) which is written in the old annotation of "The Tale of Genji" in the Tale of Genji is not existing in the text of "Makura no Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), and this is a complicated process of making a complicated process.

Among them, the Sakai-bon manuscript was compiled in "Gunsho ruiju" (a collection of historical documents compiled by Imperial command), and the third volume of Sakai-bon was included in the "Gunsho ruiju" (a collection of historical documents compiled by Imperial command).
In addition, because Noin bon was used as the original edition of the old-type printing edition in the early Edo period (Kanei era), it became a set of commentaries such as "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) and "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book) and "Haru no Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book).

The "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow of the Pillow Book) was deeply loved by human existence, and it was formed as a beauty of various kinds of species in each rank.
In some parts of each chapter from the next chapter, there are various abundant materials inside the context of each chapter, which are not distinguished from the idea of the universe and the universe of the universe and the fence of the horse, and the expression of his own expression (Ogigaya).
The expression of 'season' is based on the fact that the word 'season' (spring) was used in Kokinshu (the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), which was seen in Kokinshu (the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poems) at that time, followed a telephone of the 'spring' and 'Hana' (Hana)--while he was familiar with the traditional Japanese tradition of waka (Japanese traditional Japanese poetry), he was a new person who was familiar with the sense of consciousness of consciousness of beauty.
She appeared in the memory of Teishi, Chugu (the second consort of an emperor), Teishi.
It was written in order to calm the soul of Sadako who died during the midst of misfortunes that Michitaka had declined.
Therefore, there is no description about the decline of the Michitaka's family as a result of the decline of the Michitaka's family (mentioned above).
In the chapter of his own talent, even when the emperor took Chugu, and chugu (the second consort of an emperor), he claimed that he lived in the world of love with the Emperor because he was a favorite of the Emperor, and he insisted that he did not have any relationship with politics (Ueno Ri).
criticism
Even though he forgot from Sei Shonagon, he was a shocked figure who tried to become a member of the same class (Akiyama).
(There is no respect to those who are in the status of their relatives, not only their relatives, but also those who have a high social status are high rank.)
It does not have been written by the qualification of 'individual' instead of 'Bunmei no Bunmei' (records of civilization) of Teishi's kokyu (empress's residence).
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), who reigned from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867.
He was the only shogun who did not attend the duties of the shogun in the Edo-jo Castle.
He was the Naidaijin (the Minister of the Interior), Juichii (Junior First Rank) and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.
He was a member of the House of Peers (Japan).
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, who served as a guardian, he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
After Emperor Meiji returned his political power (= Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor) to the Emperor Meiji, he aimed at the Kobu Gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate) but in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he returned from the Osaka-jo Castle to the Edo Castle while he left the former bakufu army and was ordered to hunt down and kill the Imperial Court, and he was confined to the Imperial Court and forced to surrender the Edo-jo Castle without blood.
In the Meiji period, he died of his hobbies and lived as a duke until the Taisho period.
Yoshinobu' is also read as 'Yoshinobu' or 'Keiki' as a common name.
There is a record that 'Yoshihisa' was read as 'Yoshihisa' in the official documents of the Edo bakufu such as the official documents of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
His name is also written in the alphabet signatures and the English newspaper 'Yohoshi.'
In Mito City, where he was born, he is often called 'Yoshinobu' but in Shizuoka City, where he lived there is often called 'Keiki.'
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu during his lifetime, Yoshinobu seemed to be fond of 'Keiki-sama,' and he called himself 'Keiki' in the telephone of his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA, who was the successor of Yoshinobu, was also called 'Keyu sama' by people around him.
The two names of 'Kiki-sama' and 'Keijiki-san' can be found in modern times, but the names of 'Keii-san' are not limited to Shizuoka today, and in both cases they are often found in various places, they are often used as "very close association."
Ryotaro SHIBA, who was referred to as a former retainer of the shogunate, said 'many people were related to the former retainers of the Tokugawa shogunate, but it can be said that they were deeply respected in the broad area because they were used by those involved in the Higo Domain who were involved in the overthrow of the Shogunate.
On October 29, 1837, he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa, Edo.
His mother was Yoshiko, the lawful wife of his lawful wife, Yoshiko (the third shogun, Iemitsu TOKUGAWA), who became the legal wife of the third shogun after Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.
However, the real mother of Iemitsu is said to be Oe no kata, who was the lawful wife of his father, Hidetada, but there is a theory that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother.
His childhood name was Shichiromaro.
In accordance with the educational policy of Nariaki, he moved to the Mito Domain seven months after his birth, and after he succeeded the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, many of his studies and martial arts were taught by Shosai ISAWA, etc.
Yoshinobu seemed to have attracted attention from those days, and Nariaki thought that Nariaki was not adopted by other families at first, and he thought that he did not have any adopted son to other families, and he thought that he had to remain in his hands as a hika of his eldest son (legitimate son) and Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA.
On August 1, 1847, the bakufu ordered Shichiromaro from the Mito Domain to become the successor of the Hitotsubashi family.
After that, Shichiromaro succeeded the Hitotsubashi family on September 1, and in December he was given the name of Yoshinobu by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence and thought that Yoshinobu was a powerful candidate for the successor of the shogun, but he gave up the proposal of Masahiro ABE, roju (member of shogun's council of elders).
In 1853, during the chaos of the arrival of the Black Ships, Shogun Ieyoshi died of illness and the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA did not have a son in poor health due to his poor health and there was a problem that 'the heir of the Shogun.'
A conflict between Nariaki and Masahiro ABE, the lord of the Satsuma Domain, Nariakira SHIMAZU, and Naoyoshi SHIMAZU, who recommended Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Kishu Domain, Naosuke II, the lord of the Hikone Domain and the real mother of Iesada's mother, Honjuin.
The Hitotsubashi school tried to put Tenshoin as the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU's adopted daughter, Tenshoin into O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside), but after the death of Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU, Naosuke II, who became Tairo (chief minister) and became Tairo (chief minister) in 1858.
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan.
Yoshinobu went to Fujiki-jo Castle with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA, the lord of the Fukui Domain, but on the other hand, he was accused of Naosuke's crime and was confined to retirement in 1859 (the Ansei no Taigoku).
It is said that Yoshinobu did not want to become the heir of the shogun, but he sent a letter from Nariaki to Nariaki saying 'It is not a translation.'
In 1860, he was put under house arrest.
In 1862, the Imperial envoy Shigenori OHARA was guarded by the Satsuma army led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, and the Emperor Komei issued an imperial order to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as a guardian, Shungaku MATSUDAIRA (Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA) to become Tairo (chief minister).
On July 6, the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu to the position of Shogun and Shungaku to the position of Seiji sosai.
Yoshinobu and Shungaku did not carry out the reformation of the shogunate called Bunkyu Reforms (Bunkyu Reform), and established Kyoto Shugoshoku (Military governor of Kyoto) and relied on Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In 1863, he went to Kyoto as the pioneer of the Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court who was in charge of the expulsion of foreigners.
When the Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners, Iemochi was unable to decide the expulsion of foreigners from the emperor and ordered Iemochi to have an audience with Iemochi, who was called 'fictitious illness.'
After the Sonno Joi ha (supporters of the doctrine of the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners) led by the Choshu clan was expelled due to the Coup of August 18 (old lunar calendar), he went back to Kyoto again to participate in the council of councilors led by the Kobu-gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate) and the Sabaku-ha (supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate).
However, it can be said that the meeting was not accepted, and it can be said that he was drunk in the sake seats of the Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko and defeated Munenari DATE, Shungaku MATSUDAIRA, and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU who were staying in the palace, and also asked NAKAGAWA to discuss the situation that he could not be able to do it, and he also made an end of the situation.
After that, he was appointed to the governor of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto, Katamori MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Aizu clan) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Kuwana Domain), who served as Shugoshiki (military governor) and Shugoshiki (military governor) of the Imperial Court, and was in charge of controlling the royalists and court nobles (Ichikai-bashi Bridge and Kuwana Domain).
In the Tenguto War, Kounsai TAKEDA and other vassals of the Mito Domain, who supported Yoshinobu, showed the coolness of his family and vassals of the Mito Domain.
In 1864, he led the army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in the Kinmon Incident, and attacked the Choshu army that occupied the Takatsukasa residence.
After the first conquest of Choshu, he worked hard for the Imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce which had been without imperial sanction and succeeded in obtaining the Imperial sanction of the United States.
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu received an imperial order of conquest of Choshu.
However, the army of the bakufu refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma Domain who had formed the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance, but was defeated.
On July 20, during the second conquest of Choshu, Shogun Ieshige died in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu took part in the Imperial Court and succeeded in the conclusion of the Agreement of the war.
Although he was recommended to be the successor of Iemochi, Yoshinobu firmly refused it.
On August 20, the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of shogun, but the position of Shogun continued to be rejected.
After that, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) asked him to assume the position of shogun, but he did not accept it, and on December 5, he was appointed as Shogun by the Emperor of the Imperial Court.
In other words, he became a shogun in the form of selling his favor and tried to promote political advantage.
Yoshinobu was supported by the French minister, Léon LES, and he established the iron office of 240 million dollars from France, and he invited the military advisers such as Julian and Britain to reform the military's reform.
In addition, he also encouraged his younger brother Akutake TOKUGAWA to study in Paris World Exposition, and he encouraged his younger brother Europe to study in Paris where he sent to the Paris World Exposition Exhibition.
In the issue of the opening of Hyogo port, the Imperial Court was permitted.
Yoshinobu predicted the 'secret imperial decree to overthrow the shogunate from the Satsuma and Choshu,' and on November 14, 1867, he was sent back to the Imperial Court and received an imperial sanction (Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor) on the following day.
It is said that the Imperial Court judged that there was no administrative capability, and tried to find the continuation of the Tokugawa government in the form of leading the council of feudal lords.
However, due to the plot of Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA, the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December and Yoshinobu was ordered to resign from the position of Naidaijin and the dedication of the Tokugawa territory.
Yoshinobu left the Osaka-jo Castle in order to avoid conflicts, and he advocated the legitimacy of the Tokugawa clan by gathering ministers from foreign countries, and he also made a campaign to revise the Imperial Court in order to revise his resignation.
However, the following year, 1868, the Satsuma clan raised an army in the city of Edo, and the soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana were forced to use the soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana Domains.
However, in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi which broke out on January 3, the old Shogunate army was disadvantageous and even though it was still enough to maintain its military force, he left the army and retreated to Edo in the military epic "Kaiyo Maru" (The Battle of Toba-Fushimi).
Soon after that, the order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu's enemy, and the government army led by the Minister of the Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito started the expedition to the east.
Yoshinobu insisted on the resistance faction that Tadaosa ORIKURI was at the beginning of the battle, and insisted on allegiance to him.
In February, Kaishu KATSU appointed Kaishu KATSU to his position and himself was confined in Daiji-in Temple in Ueno Kanei-ji Temple.
In addition, he was adopted by Yasunosuke TAYASU, who later became the head of the Tokugawa family.
After the negotiation between Katsu and Takamori SAIGO, the staff officer of the government and the staff of the government army, the Edo Castle was bloodshed and Yoshinobu was transferred to Mito and continued to stay in the house of the Kokudo (domain school) of hanko (domain school).
In July, the Tokugawa family moved to Sunpu where the Tokugawa family was transferred to Sunpu.

He died on November 22, 1913 at 4 a.m. in the morning.
On the same day, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.
As for the study of military arts and academy, he was born in the highest environmental environment, and he was enthusiastic about swordplay from various martial arts.
Even after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), he is counted as one of the most famous swordsmiths of the art of swordsmanship, which does not hold the training of the back of the swordplay.
When his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA was hiding in the barrel, his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA was just a threat of the barrel, and it is said that the sword was removed from the barrel.
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he became adulthood, he was in the same position as two of his wife and two mistresses in the name of 'Y' (Y) and his three mistress.
Yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph in his childhood, but it is doubtful that the photograph of Yoshinobu could not be found in Japan during his childhood.
It is said that he visited Iemochi, who fell ill and fell ill and became popular at that time.
He was known for his bravery, and when he criticized Yoshinobu as his real father, Nariaki TOKUGAWA and Tatewaki YASUSHIMA as 'the Tokugawa flow of the Tokugawa family,' he was given the position of Shogun by taking advantage of the expectation of the power of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), he was praised as 'Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.'
Yoshinobu was also aware of the anti-shogunate faction, and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan especially said that 'Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI is not an inaccurate tactic of Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI.'
He was cautious about Ieyasu that he would come back again.
Ryoma SAKAMOTO, in response to the resolution of Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), stated that 'Dainichi (shogun [shogunate]) was the ruler of the present day, and the current mind of the present day is the best of the current mind.
It is often said that it is necessary to be given to him and it is often given to him.
He made his mind and pledge to evaluate him, and Yoshinobu tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser of the new government to Yoshinobu.
However, Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was a person who knew the existence of Ryoma, and after the death of Ryoma, he became a member of the Meiji period.
There was no story about Yoshinobu and Ryoma's acquaintance in his lifetime was very lower than that of the Meiji Restoration.
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and went back to Edo, and was greatly criticized by his enemy.
At that time, Ieyasu forgot the horse seals of gold fans from Ieyasu but he did not forget his favorite concubine, and he was ridiculed for Yoshinobu's weakness.
However, there is a theory that Yoshinobu needed to oppose armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces, and because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the Imperial Court, he was forced to avoid the intervention of foreign countries, even if he was in a long-term fight, even though he had to protect Osaka-jo Castle due to the fact that he could not interfere with foreign countries.
It is highly evaluated that the Emperor and the Imperial Court were placed under house arrest in Kanei-ji Temple because they were thought to be an enemy of the new government, and on the other hand, they were thought to be a person who valued the emperor and the Imperial Court (Mitogaku (Mitogaku [Mitogaku [Mitogaku [Mitogaku thought of reverence for the Emperor] and his mother are thought to have been from the Imperial Family), but on the other hand, the other hand, they were not able to show their loyalty to the enemy.
It is highly evaluated that the modern independence of Japan was protected due to the fact that it was close to the unbroken revolutionary revolution, because it was close to the unbroken revolutionary revolution, and the restoration of the Meiji Restoration was highly evaluated due to the fact that it was a great achievement in the Meiji Restoration.
Eichi SHIBUSAWA, a businessman, was a vassal who was appointed to the family head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, and after the Meiji Restoration, he had a close relationship with the Meiji Restoration.
In the last days of Yoshinobu, Shibusawa tried to compile the biography of Yoshinobu, and persuaded Yoshinobu, who was astonished and asked him to listen to Naoyoshi's talent.
The book was compiled in the ""Konjaku Yumeji hikki" (a record of Yumeji in the past).
According to a part of the Dankai, it is written in the form of a meeting, and it can be said that it is a slight voice of Yoshinobu who was an old age.
It can be guessed that at the age of time, Hisamitsu said that 'Hisamitsu SHIMAZU was not very fond of Hisamitsu SHIMAZU' and 'Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was a person who was not a man of good luck.'
Based on these materials, the book was completed after Yoshinobu died, and it was "Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA" (Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA).
In order to show gratitude for the Emperor Meiji, who was the highest rank of the kazoku (peerage) and the highest rank of kazoku (peerage) was given to the Emperor Meiji, Yoshinobu made a will to perform the Shinshiki (ritual ceremony), instead of the Buddhist ritual.
As a result, the grave of Yoshinobu was not found in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Zojo-ji Temple, which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family, and a round barrow similar to that of the Imperial family was built in Tanaka Cemetery.
This was due to the fact that the imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei was inferior to that of Emperor Komei (according to "Tokawa Yoshinobu Oden").
When Yoshinobu was pardoned, he wrote that he was a roju (member of shogun's council of elders) Katsukiyo ITAKURA, who was a member of the shogun's council of elders who wanted to give his life to the former shogun's retainers who had offered his life for his life, and then he said that he would have been in love with Yoshinobu.
In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, there was a weak image of 'enemy escape' in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, but after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), the new modern political system has been reviewed in recent years, and some of them have been broadcast by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Taiga drama).
As with his father, Nariaki, he was fond of pork in the Satsuma Domain, and he was called 'Buda Ichi-sama' or 'Ichiba-sama' (a kind of pork and pork were fond of meat).
In his later years, he loved bread and milk, and in his later years, he began to learn French language from Shusai NISHI (Keimo) when he was a shogun when he enjoyed his hobbies such as a photograph by cucumber, a bicyclopedia, a bicyclopedia, a bicyclopedia and a handicap (embroidered).
It is famous as a camera many, but it seems that the technique of camera filming was not progressed.
He often wrote photographic magazine, but it is said that he did not adopt it.
In addition, his great-grandson Yoshinaga TOKUGAWA was a cameraman, and his photograph which was owned by the Yoshinobu family was discovered by Yoshinobu was discovered and published by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA.
He was a friend of his hobbies and was a younger brother of Akitake TOKUGAWA.
On December 3, 1854, he married Mikako ICHIJO (he changed his name to Mikako MIGA after the Meiji Restoration).
Although his eldest daughter (Keikoin no ike-ike ike ike ike ike Pond and the present daughter of Odoi Odo) was born on July 16, 1851, he died young on July 20.
After that, she did not have a child, and in the Meiji period, the 10th son and the 11th daughter who was born in the Meiji period, all had two concubines and two concubines.
Keihisa, the seventh son of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, the seventh son of Kaishu KATSU, and the 10th son Sei, who became the husband of Kaishu KATSU, became the adopted son-in-law of Kaishu KATSU, and the ninth daughter Tsuneko became the wife of Prince Fushiminomiya Hiroyasu and became the wife of Prince Fushiminomiya Hiroka.
Yoshihisa, a son of Yoshihisa, was Yoshiko, a wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito who became the wife of Imperial Prince Takamatsunomiya Nobuhito and a wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito.
His lawful wife was Mikako ICHIJO (changed to Kinhisa IMADEGAWA's daughter and adopted by Tadaka ICHIJO), and he became an adopted daughter from July 19, 1836 to July 9, 1877).

Note:
Nara Line is a railway line operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) from Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture, to Kyoto Station in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
The entire line is included in the suburbs of large cities.
Since the Kansai Main Line has its origin as a branch line of the Kansai Main Line, the official starting point is Kizu Station, but the train runs from Kyoto to Kizu (the number of the train numbers), and the inbound train is the same as that of the train number.
Except for the following railway dates, it will be described in the section from Kyoto to Kizu.
The color of the line is brown (?), and it is said that the reason for the selection is that 'two ancient capitals of the capital.'
jurisdiction: West Japan Railway Company (JR West) (JR West) (JR West) (JR West) (JR West) (JR West)
Railway distance (operating kilometers): 34.7 km
Track gauge: 1067 mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the end of the station)
Double-tracked section: between Shinden Station and Uji Station, JR Fujinomori Station and Kyoto Station
Electrified section: entire line electrified (Electronic 1500V)
Block (railway) system: automatic block system (double-tracked section), single-track automatic block system (single-track)
Safety device: Automatic Train Depot
Operation Division: Shin-Osaka General Center
Maximum speed: 110 km/h (double-tracked section); 95 km/h (single-track)
The Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) West Japan Railway Company (JR West) except Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) (Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
The line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line, but all sections are located in Kyoto Prefecture, and there are no railway lines in Nara Prefecture.
Although the Nara Railway was originally constructed by Nara Railway, the line between Kyoto and Nara was split into a part of the Kansai Railway Company; after it was merged into the Kansai Railway Company, it was separated from Osaka and Nagoya as a part of the Nagoya Route.
However, trains are operated from Kizu Station to the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line), while Nara Station is operated by Nara Station.
JR West announced the nickname of the line (JR Kyoto Line and JR Kobe Line) in each line of the Urban Network on March 13, 1988, but the Nara Line was sent to the Nara Line.
Because the Kintetsu Nara Line is located on the Kintetsu Nara Line, it is sometimes referred to as 'JR Nara Line.'
In the era of Japan National Railways (JNR), the name 'JNR Nara Line' was used as a guide and the English name of the board was also written as 'JR.'
The Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Naniwa, Nara and Nara, and the JR Nara Line is the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which is in rivalry with the JR Nara Line.
While many trains operated in parallel with the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, the Nara Line could not be electrified until 1984 when JNR was electrified, and only a small local line with two cars of JNR 105 series of JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 105 was used for a short period of time until 1984.
However, after JR West was inaugurated, the train was reorganized into four-car trains in the Urban Network network, and the increase of rapid trains such as 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' was rapidly improved due to the increase of rapid trains such as 'Miyakoji Rapid Service.'
At present, it has a strong nature as a commuting and a line of travel from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Byodo-in Temple in Uji City, where Uji City is located along the line, and Joyo City.
However, it is a circular shape on the east side of the Momoyama - Shinden section, and in the south of Joyo City, the Kintetsu Kyoto Line runs parallel in parallel with the Kyoto Line running outside the central part of the town, the distance between Keina and the area is still different.
Although the trains of Nara Train Depot are used for Nara Train Depot of the Osaka branch station, the station is managed by Kyoto Branch except for Kizu Station.
The J-Thru ICOCA, ICOCA, and the Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), TOICA and PiTaPa of KANSAI THRU PASTHRU PASS can be used at all stations.
In the south of Joyo Station, the station is a simple ticket gate that is located on the south side of Joyo Station.
In 1984, the limited express 'Kuroshio' operated between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station was abolished by the Nara Line, Sakurai Line, Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line, and until 1991, only local trains were operated as local trains until 1991, but nowadays there are four types of local trains that were operated between Miyakoji Station and Rapid trains, Rapid trains, Rapid and local trains.
It is the nearest type of the Nara Line, and is mainly operated during the daytime mainly during the daytime.
Basically, a local train connects with a local train and a local train at Uji Station because of the intervals of 30 minutes.
The nickname of 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' was decided by the public before the operation started.
Many of the trains that connect Kyoto and Nara, which are tourist spots, use not only Japanese but also foreigners, but also for tourists.
All the trains are operated in the JR West Series 221 and are operated with four-car trains or six cars.
The maximum speed of the double-track section is 110 km/h and the maximum speed is operated at 110 km/h, and the speed is 95 km/h other than that is 95 km/h.
Approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara, and approximately 47 minutes from Nara to Nara.
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamitakoma Station or Tanakura Station in the middle of the station, and there are some differences between the inbound and outbound trains that go to Nara because they are different from the Nara no Miyakoji rapid train.
During the three days of the new year, Inari Station temporarily stopped at Inari Station in order to visit Fushimi Inari Station.
History
March 3, 2001: The operation began operating.
March 15, 2003: Due to the revision of the timetable revision, the station began to stop at Tofukuji Station and Tamamizu Station.
It is operated during the morning and evening rush hours.
It also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture).
All trains are operated in the Series 221 and are operated with four-car trains or six cars.
Basically, a local train connects with a local train and a local train at Uji Station because of the intervals of 30 minutes.
In the same way as the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above, the Yamatoji Line rapid trains stop at Hirayama Station, which is operated by the Yamatoji Line.
The stops of 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' were used until March 2001 when 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' was introduced, and the JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 117 was used in Kyoto and Uji, Kizu and Nara, but the Nara Line has not been used since then.
In the morning and evening, there are trains that directly connect the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line.
It is mainly operated in the morning and night.
It was originally a weekday, but was operated only on Saturday and holidays due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 18, 2006.
Although trains stop at each station between Uji Station and Nara Station, there was a rapid train bound for Kizu in the vicinity of midnight due to the difference between the local trains bound for Uji Station and the local trains running in the vicinity of the station, but nowadays the local train running in the section was changed to a train that ran at the end of the local rapid train.
There are some trains that use JNR 103 series JNR 103 from Kyoto Station on Saturdays and holidays, and all trains are operated on the 221 series 21.
During the morning rush hour there is a train that runs directly from the Yamatoji Line because it is convenient.
As rapid trains on the Nara Line tried to avoid mistakes with rapid trains in the Yamatoji Line, the color of oranges was used as a line color, but due to the revision of the timetable revision of March 2008, the type of local rapid trains in the section was used as a greenhouse for the revision of the timetable revision of March 2008.
In the postmark of the station on the north side of Kamikoma Station, it is described as a purple letter.
It runs between Kyoto Station and Uji, Joyo and Nara Station.
During the daytime the section between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station runs every 15 minutes, but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station is 30 minutes.
Basically, trains are operated on the 103 series cars, but some trains are operated on the 221 Line.
In the early morning and late evening, there are trains that directly connect the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late evening.
In the past, there was a direct train with the Sakurai Line, but on September 4, 1994, the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided into two lines: the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line.
Although it was a special train, limited express trains were sometimes operated on the Nara Line.
From 1987 to 1988, the name 'Kuroshi (train)' was changed from 1987 to 1989 by the nickname of 'Kuroshi (train)' to Hakuhama Station on the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line of the Kansai Main Line and the Hanwa Line via the Kansai Main Line, the Kansai Main Line and the Kansai Main Line.
In the Kinki Shinbun Newspaper published on January 6, 1998, there was an announcement that a limited express train would run on the Nara Line with 381 series of limited express trains on the Nara Line (commuter train), but the plan was stopped after that.
Although it was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai (Miyakoji Rapid Service operated between Kyoto and Nara) as the Miyakoji Route, there were no direct trains to the Sakurai Line except for special purposes.
In the middle of August, the Uji-gawa River Fireworks Fireworks held on the nearest side of the Uji Station, but since the schedule schedule is usually limited to the final schedule, only local trains run between Kyoto and Uji only 10 minutes.
There are some local trains that arrive at and depart from Kizu Station.
The special schedule of the New Year's Day at that time became completely different and the rapid trains stopped at each station between Kyoto and Uji Station, and the number of trains was increased to the Uji Station.
Depending on the year, there were some trains that came back to Momoyama Station.
In 1992, direct trains bound for the Sakurai Line extended regular rapid trains on Saturdays and holidays mainly on Saturdays and holidays, and one hour was operated between Tenri Station and Tenri Station.
In addition, special trains that are operated by a group have been used throughout Japan.
Particularly, when the Tenri Religious Festival held every October 26, the trains called 'special trains for the Tenri Line' are operated between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station on the Nara Line and the Yamatoji Line between Nara Station and Nara Station and Sakurai Line.
All of them belonged to Nara Train Depot.
JR West Suburban Train Series 221
It is common to use the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line, and there are two cars, four cars and six cars.
It is mainly operated by four-car trains and six cars of 'Miyakoji Rapid Service' or 'Rapid train,' but mainly four cars are operated on the Nara Line.
Two sets of two-car trains are used for holidays and holidays.
JNR/JR Limited Express Series 103
The four-car train used for local trains of the Nara Line is used not only for the Nara Line, but also for the Nara Loop Line but the Nara Loop Line but also the Yamatoji Line and the Yamatoji Line during rush hours.
Some cars of the Osaka Loop Line are replaced by cars that are transferred from the Morinomiya Train Depot.

Keiji Bypass is a bypass of National Highway Route from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is designated as a plan for regional high-standard roads
The following is the section on the Keiji Bypass of the Uryo Road and the Keiji Bypass of National Route 1 and National Route 24.
It is integrated with the Meishin Expressway and is connected with the Kuridashi Interchange of the Meishin Expressway, Nagoya City and Osaka City Interchange.
By the law, the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama Yodo Interchange are designated as National Highway Route 1 and National Route 478, and the Kumiyama Interchange (Keiji Bypass), the Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange and Oyamazaki Junction, National Highway Route No. 478, the Kokudo Jidoshado Expressway, the Kokudo Jidoshado Expressway (special highway for the National Highway Expressway), the Kokudo Jidoshado Expressway, and the National Highway Highway Route No. 2, the Oyamazaki Interchange, as well as the National Highway Highway Route No. 478, and the National Highway Route No. 2, the National Highway Route No. 2, the Kyoto Prefectural Road No. 2 and the Oyamazaki Interchange of the National Highway Route No. 78 are designated as the National Highway Highway Route 48.
As the plan was planned later, the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway was built in order to improve the delay of the Meishin Expressway and the construction of roads that had functions of Kyoto City and Kyoto City as well as the Kyoto Bypass with the Kyoto Tanba Road and the Keiji Bypass which was a bypass of National Highway Route 9 due to the necessity of the construction of roads.
The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Loop Expressway have been designated National Highway 478 and has been maintained consistently.
According to the indication of the line, it is considered to be a Keiji Bypass in the Seta JC-TT, and it is considered to be a Keiji Bypass in the Seta Junction.
In addition, the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass are not differently different from the ETC system.
According to this article, Keiji Bypass (from the Seta Higashi Interchange to Oyamazaki JCT), which is the name of the business route, will be described as the Keiji Bypass.

As for the background of the interchange, the road shows the section where the road is used for the use of the interchange.
In addition, it shows that the background of the facility name of the facility is the same as that of the facility, and the facilities are not used for facilities.
Roads that do not specify the lines are operated by local municipalities.

(In addition, the section under the management of the Ibaraki Management Office is the Kyoto-Higashi Interchange of Meishin Expressway, Suita JC, Daini-Keihan-do Road and Keinawa Jidoshado Expressway.)
August 29, 1988: The Seta Higashi Interchange and JCT-JC-JC-JT-CT/Ogura-Interchange were opened.
March 30, 2003: The Ogura-Interchange - Kumiyama JC-TS opened.
As a result, the tolling system was unified by the other Nippon Road Public Corporation (today's Network).
August 10, 2003: The entire line was opened as a result of the opening of the section between Kumiyama JCT and Oyamazaki JCT.
December 24, 2003: The Oyamazaki Interchange was opened.

The Uji Tunnel of this route is the longest 4,313 meters in the National Route 1, and the tunnels, except for the Uji-higashi Interchange and the Kasatori Interchange, are prohibited.
In the vicinity of the Kumiyama Junction, the film was shot in the film "Dancing One" before the opening of the Kumiyama Junction.
When the distance between Seta Interchange and Oyamazaki Interchange and JCT, the Keiji Bypass is shorter than the Meishin Expressway, the Keiji Bypass is more shorter than the Meishin Expressway, and when it runs on the maximum speed of the maximum speed of the station, the Keiji Bypass runs earlier than the Keiji Bypass via the Keiji Bypass.
Since there are no rest facilities such as the service area, the Meishin Expressway is often crowded with the Meishin Expressway, and the rest of the Meishin Expressway, the Seta Higashi and Oyamazaki rest facilities for the Meishin Expressway, the Otsu Service Area, and the Katsuragawa Park.
However, the structure of both Seta and Oyamazaki JCT, which were built after the name of the god, is a very complicated structure (especially the structure of the JCTTT of Oyamazaki JCT, which is a very complicated structure, has a complicated structure, is the same as that of the road in which the road is operated through the area where the road is operated by the OYAMAZAKI.
When you go from Oyamazaki JTT to Suita and Osaka from the Oyamazaki JT, there is an inconvenience that you can get along the Meishin Expressway and the left side of the Meishin Expressway.
In addition, since the curve and the sloping road have continued, there are quite a few passages to respect them, so it does not function as a bypass of the Meishin Expressway because it is a bypass of Meishin Expressway.
As this road is a bypass of National Route 1 (general national road), this road is an exclusive road for motorcycles and is not a highway for high-speed Expressway.
In the case of the Keiji Bypass from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the direction of the Uji-gawa River, it is necessary to go through the Uji Nishi Interchange to the Keiji Bypass in the direction of the Uji-gawa River.
This is because the Uji-higashi Interchange is an abruptcy IC of the Uji-higashi Interchange.
For this reason, the general road section between the Uji Higashi Interchange and the Uji Nishi Interchange is often traffic during the time of commution.
This general road section is located in the direction of the VISR, so it is difficult to measure the traffic delay.

Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Shinshu sect (the Jodo Shinshu sect), which is one of the Shinshu sect organizations, and is the head temple of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) along with the head temple of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple (the formal name of the Hongan-ji school of the Jodo Shinshu sect).
The official name of the temple was 'Hongan-ji Temple' until 1987, and after the same year, it was 'Shinshu Honbyo Mausoleum.'
It is often called 'Oto san' because it is distinguished from Nishi Hongan-ji Temple in Shimogyo Ward.
(Refer to the article on the history of Hongan-ji Temple before the split into east and west.
When the 12th head of Hongan-ji Temple, Kyonyo (光寿) (光寿) was given a temple territory in the east of Hongan-ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, Kyonyo was established in 1602 when Hongan-ji Temple was divided into two parts.

Amaterasu Omikami is a god (human) appearing in Japanese mythology.
In the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), when it was enshrined as a god of nature, it is called 'Ameteru.'
It is one of the deities that deify the sun and are considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial family.
In the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is written as 天照大神神 (天照大神) in the Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters), and in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), it is written as 天下神神, and it is written as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
He was also called Ohirume no Muchi no Kami.
In the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), several gods were described in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), but in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it was unified by the name of the god called 'Tensho Daijin' in the name of the god.
Although she was a goddess, there is a theory that she was actually a male god.
Since the name of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as "Kotai Jingu Gishiki," it is said that Takamimusubi (Takamimusubi no mikoto) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and Takamimusubi (Takamimusubi no Mikoto, Takamimusubi no mikoto) was originally the ancestor of the Emperor and became the ancestor of the Imperial family.
In the Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amazume no Okami or Sumeramikami, or when the name of the god is enshrined before the festival, it is also referred to as Amateruimasu no kami or Amenosakasume-no-kami when the god is enshrined.
In academic documents today, the word 'Amaterasu' and katakana are used as a custom.
There is a theory that it was written as 天照太神.
Description in mythology
According to the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), when Izanagi came back from the land of Izanami, he was born when he washed off the impurities of the dead and washed his left eyes.
At that time, he was born from the right eye and was born from the nose, together with Susanoo who was born from the nose, and he was called Mikoshi (three noble children).
At that time, Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) to govern Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Susanoo who was entrusted to Kaibara continued to cry that he would go to Nenokuni where Izanami had lived, so he was expelled by Izanami.
Susanoo met his older sister, Amaterasu Omikami, before he went to Nenokuni (the Nine Kingdom), and he went to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), but Amateru Oomikami thought that his younger brother would take over Takamanohara (plain of high heaven) and waited for him.
In order to prove the purity of Susanoo, the three goddesses were born from the real power of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) to the five pillars, and Susanoo declared the victory.
He was born from the real power of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and was regarded as a child of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and the following five deities are deities of the following five gods.
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Hikutsuhikone
Kusunokuten
Susano who was frightened by this, worked in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and as a result, Amaterasu Omikami hid herself in Ama no Iwato (heavenly rock cave).
In the middle of the world, there were various troubles in the world.
(The eight hundred million deities including Yagorogi no mikoto and Amenokoyane no mikoto succeeded in making Amaterasu Omikami, the god of Chichibu-no-kami, the god of Chichibu-no-kami, the god of Chichibu-no-kami, the god of Chichibu-no-kami, and so on, and Susanoo was expelled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
He sent his son Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no nakatsukuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains) to descend to Ashihara no nakatsukuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
When Ashihara no nakatsukuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains) was pacified, Amenouzumimi descended to the throne, but Ninigi, who was the grandson of Ninigi was born.
interpretation
In the mythology, there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be the god of the nation because he showed the action of Amatsukami (Takamimusubi no mikoto) who was born earlier than himself or in the mythology, and because there is a scene in which Amaterasu Omikami was in accordance with the instructions of the god.
There is also a view that it was a deification of miko in ancient times.
It is also called '日女女' (日女女) and refers to miko (a shrine maiden) who served the sun god.
The sun god was originally a male god, but there is a theory that the shrine maiden who served was identified with the sun god was identified with the sun god and became a goddess.
In addition, there is a theory that this goddess was established in the era of Empress Jito, who was a female emperor, and that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
It is pointed out that the birth of the sun and Tsukuyomi (Tsukuyomi or Tsukuyomi no kami) of the sun and Tsukuyomi (Tsukuyomi (Tsukuyomi (Tsukuyomi or Tsukuyomi (Tsukuyomi no kami) was strongly influenced by Taoism in the "Ryoho Gopu" (before the sixth century), which is a Buddhist sutra of Taoism and the "Ryoho Gofu" (the first half of the sixth century), and the "Nenyo" (the first half of the seventh century), 'Meigetsukyo' (the first day of the right eye of the left eye of the eye' (the first month of the seventh century).
In addition, the belief that Ise-jingu Shrine enshrines Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), the Ise-jingu Shrine, the Saigu, the Saigu, the Saikan, the Saikan, the Saikan, the Shigi no Mura no Miya, the Miginu (purification), and Usukinou (white silk fabric) are divided into the names of the five colors, and the Taoist gods, and the Taoist theory of the Ojingu Shrine is consistent.
According to comparative mythology, the birth mythology of Amaterasu Omikami was almost equal to that of the ancient mythological mythology which records the ancient period (3 to 4 centuries), which was recorded earlier than that of ancient times.
Also, there is a myth that it is regarded as the day of the solar calendar, because it spread to Japan along with the ethnic groups in the earlier history.
In "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), there is a theory that the shrine was transformed into the third stage.
The following is a summary of the incident and the contents of the movement.
645: Taika Reforms
Before that, the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Hijin no kami' (日神神) (日神神) (日神神) (日神) (日神) (日神) (日神) (日神) is '日神' (日神' (日神).
A male god called 'Ameru,' was widely enshrined there.
In the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines such as 'Akamasu-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima, 'Issunimasu Amateru' in Harima, and 'Ameteru' in Tanba.
For reference, it is another name for Amenohoakari who was a grandson of Amaterasu, and Amenohoakari is also the founder of the Owari clan, the Tsunamori clan, and the Kaibe clan.
In addition, the younger brother of Amenohoakari was Ninigi and the great-grandfather of Emperor Jinmu.
672: The Jinshin War
Ohihirume no Muchi no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Mu no Muchime' or 'Tanatatsutatsume'
In this case, the enshrined deity is interpreted as Ohirume no Sumeramikoto, who is a goddess, and there is an interpretation that it is the 'ameteru' of a snake.
698: Kotai-jingu Shrine was established.
Amaterasu (the Sun Goddess) and 'the ancestor of the Imperial family.'
She was a goddess.
Emperor Jito was modeled after the Emperor Jito, and it was created from a natural god to a humanity god.
Even after that, the term 'heaven' other than Koto-shin (ancestor honored as god) was called 'amateru.'
For example, in "Sarashina Nikki" (Tarashina Diary), it is written as '天照御神' (1060), and '天照神' (天照神) is also read as 'ameru,' and also in 'Amatsuhirume' in "Sendai Kujihongi" (Ancient Japanese History).
1880 - 1881, a fierce controversy occurred over the enshrined deities of the Shinto Jimukyoku Bureau in Hibiya, Tokyo.
The Shinto Jimukyoku insisted that the three deities were enshrined as the enshrined deities of the Bureau of Divinities (Amenominakanushi no Kami, Takamimusubi no kami, Takamimusubi no kami, Kamimusubi no kami), and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) should be enshrined in this world, but 'Izumo-ha' should be combined with 'Yuikai' (the world).
However, the 'Ise school' which was the center of Shinto Jimukyoku was the 'presidence' that Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) ruled the two worlds of Kenyu and insisted that other deities were not subject to subject.
In the end, there were various theories, such as 'the Izumo school had a grudge that had continued since the age of the gods, and the Imperial family should kill Senke Sonfuku, who had a bad mind in the Imperial family.'
Before long, the controversy took place due to the decision of Emperor Meiji, and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was ranked as the highest rank.
It is said that the government recognized that it was impossible to control the people directly based on the theory of Fukushin Shinto.
Refer to the controversy of the enshrined deities of State Shinto Jimukyoku (the Bureau of Shinto Shrines).
When Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA introduced Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in his own novel, he used another name 'Ohihirume no Sumeru' (also known as Ohirume no Ki).
Since the term 'Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess)'Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) does not appear in the word, the sun god or a natural god, and the word '大日日日日日比売神' (大日日日日比売神) does not have been used as '大日日比売神' (大日日日比売神) because the name of the sun god appears in the text.
In fact, there are many novels written by AKUTAGAWA who were not able to revise and revise the corrections of the army and the removal of the book.
In 1926, Masaatsu YASUOKA (1898 - 1983) founded the Kinkei Gakuin School (1926) said, 'Japan has the belief of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is the ideal of the Japanese spirit, which means that the world is lighted by the Japanese spirit.
When 'Izanagi' and 'Izanagi' were changed to 'innovative people of the world,' he said, 'If it was a pioneer of the world,' and he became an ideal person in the world.'
Shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami
The shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami are called Kamimeijinja Shrines throughout the country and the main shrine is the inner shrine (Kotai-jingu Shrine) of the Jingu Shrine (Ise-jingu Shrine).
The Kotai-jingu Shrine is a Shinto shrine that enshrines Yata no kagami, one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family.
In most shrines throughout Japan, the shinsatsu of Kotai-jingu Shrine (Ame no Kotai-jingu Shrine) is distributed in most shrines throughout Japan.

It refers to a person who was very famous for his name.
It is a small name.
It originally referred to the people who had power in the region.
In the samurai society, the term came to mean a samurai who owned many territories or the lower part of the territory.
In the Muromachi period, shugo strengthened their control and became shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords).
In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), a powerful feudal lord who established a strong control of his territory, appeared and was called Kokujin (local samurai) or Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period (period of warring states).
In the Edo period, the term was mainly used to refer to samurai families who were given 10,000 koku (crop yields) to the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
It is said that the samurai who were under the direct control of the bakufu were appointed to Jikidai (immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods).
As the feudal lord and the characteristics of the feudal lords of China shared the characteristics of the feudal lords of China, feudal lords were also called feudal lords in the same way as lords of China.
This section describes the details of the modern daimyo in the Edo period.
Refer to the article about the shugo daimyo (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) and daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period.
Daimyo in the Edo period
Daimyo in the Edo period were determined according to kakaku (family status) and yakudaka (crop yield) of kokudaka (crop yield) and shikoseki (family status of a daimyo in the Edo period) in the Edo period.
Firstly, due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family, it was classified as tozama daimyo (tozama daimyo who became vassals of the Tokugawa family) who were vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, mainly fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who was a vassal of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara.
When the shogun family became extinct, the Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family), which were allowed to use the Tokugawa family as well as the Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family), were established in order to keep the bloodline of the shogun family and to supervise the control of the whole country and to support the shogunate, and the Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family), which was allowed to use the Tokugawa family name of the Tokugawa family, was established as the same as the Shogun family, and the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA was the Owari Domain and the tenth son Yorinobu TOKUGAWA was appointed to the Mito Domain.
In addition, he appointed Hideyasu YUKI, the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA, to the Echizen Domain as well as daimyo (feudal lord) of the Tokugawa clan throughout the country.
In addition, the fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who had established the foundation of the Tokugawa Shogun family were placed as Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) and secured the military power of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and also held important posts centered on roju (member of shogun's council of elders) at the beginning of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
Although the Ii clan, the head of fudai daimyo (a hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) of fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) was given a large amount of fief of 50,000 koku, the Torii clan and the Sakakibara clan, the Honda clan, and the Ogasawara clan had more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period, the Sakai clan, the Abe clan, the Abe clan, the Horiizawa clan, the Yanagizawa clan, and so on were able to keep more than 100,000 koku in the Edo period.
This came to be used for separation of power and military power.
After the Battle of Sekigahara, tozama daimyo were daimyo who were subordinate to the Tokugawa family and many families fought against the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara.
However, he was strongly concerned about the shogunate and actively actively actively worked as intelligent activities, and he was severely punished by being punished by being deprived of his fief when he was afraid of his misfortunes or a scheme.
The most famous tozama daimyo were the Kaga Domain of the Maeda clan who were famous as Kaga Hyakudaka (crop yields of Kaga Province), the Sendai Domain and the Kuroda clan, the Mori clan, the Mori clan, the Yonezawa clan, the Saga clan, the Kumamoto Domain, the Kumamoto Domain, the Kumamoto Domain, the Tottori Domain and the Tosa clan, the Tosa clan, and the Satake clan, which were famous for the time of the Kamakura period.
In addition, the status of daimyo was divided according to the social status of daimyo (daimyo) who had more than one koku or more than one koku or more than one koku of kokudaka (crop yield) which was equivalent to that of kokushu (lord of a castle), and those with a castle were called joshukaku (lord of a castle) (joshukaku (lord of a castle) or jinya (regional government office), and daimyo were not allowed to participate in the Edo Castle.
For more information, refer to the article on the shikoseki (seats for vassals of the Tokugawa shogunate).
Daimyo were not allowed to have the status of daimyo who had a fief of 100,000 koku (approx. 180 million liters of crop yield), and most of them had territories in the vicinity of the castle and the surrounding areas.
In extreme cases, one village was divided into other feudal lords and governed one village (shokyu [salary]).
Although daimyo were more than 10,000 koku in principle, the Kiregawa Domain of the Kitsuregawa clan was 5000 koku.
This was because the Kitsuregawa clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the Buke Shohatto (laws for samurai families) and the Sankinkotai system (a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In addition, in the end of the Edo period, daimyo were appointed to the officer who was called Ote-denyaku (job of guarding the coast of the sea) or the defense of the seashore because they were ordered to defend the coast, and they always suffered financial difficulties.
The word "daimyo" is used to refer to daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).
Among the kazoku (peerage) kazoku (peerage) of daimyo (Japanese feudal lord), they were from feudal lords.

In the dictionaries of the Muromachi period, two sounds of 'taimei' (taimei), 'daimyo' (daimei) and 'daimyo' (daimyo) were used, and the former was the meaning of 'shugo (big feudal lord).'
In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), the distinction of the meaning of the sound was weak, and it is said that it was often called 'taimei.'
There are two sounds of 'daimyo' or 'taimei' in the Japanese-Portuguese dictionary written in the early 17th century, but the distinction between words is not clear, and the distinction of the word 'taimei' is not clear.
